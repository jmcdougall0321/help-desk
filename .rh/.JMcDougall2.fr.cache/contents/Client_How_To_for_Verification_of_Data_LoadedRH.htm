      ‎Client HOW-TO Verify Employees
    There are three ways you are able to verify:
     
    
      The first is through the Administration Module > People Module Item.
        
          Here you will see a list of all employees that were included in the Employee Demographic File. These individual employee/people records can be viewed manually using the edit grid button.

      The second is through the Injury and Illness Module > Injury and Illnesses Module Item.
        
          When adding a new incident the end user is asked to define the type of report, the location, and the associated employee. Here the user can search by the last name or employee number to pull from the demographics data and automatically allow for the additional data to flow by simply selecting the correct employee from the dropdown.
