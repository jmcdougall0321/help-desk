The Employee File must be provided to AIC in the appropriate template and format.

      Historical Data – The AIC Implementation Team will assist the Client with uploading Historical Data for each Module of their choice dating as far back as necessary.

      Reports and Dashboards – Throughout Implementation, AIC can train clients how to create their own custom built Reports and Dashboards.
      Training – The Implementation Team provides in depth Training on all licensed Solutions for all Administrators and Recordkeepers. These Trainings are typically done over the web via GoTo Meeting. One complimentary Onsite Training is provided during the Implementation process and is usually held just before or just after Client’s “Go-Live” Date, after at least one Administrator Training has taken place via webinar.
    
    Support Ongoing Administrative Responsibilities
    
      Organization Structure – Administrators can make manual adjustments to the Organization Structure. Clients can add Organization Levels, add Locations, and use the drag and drop feature to move Locations and Org Levels to different areas of the structure.
      Locations – Administrators can manually add new Locations or edit existing Locations using the Locations Module Item.
      Location Codes – Administrators will be responsible for adding/maintaining and new Employee Location Codes that will be utilized in the Employee Demographic/Hours feeds.
      Employees – If a Client has not chosen to set up an automated Employee File Feed, Administrators can manually add New Employees or edit existing Employee data.
      Hours - If a Client has not chosen to set up an automated Employee Hours File Feed, Administrators can manually add Employee Hours using the Employee Hours Module Item within the Injury and Illness Module.
      Profiles – Administrators have full access to make any manual adjustments to Security Profiles at any time using the Profiles Module Item within the Administration Module. It is the Client’s responsibility to maintain each Profile.
      Users – Administrators have the ability to assign any Employee as a User of the system by manually assigning a Username, Password, Profile, Email Address, and Location access. It is the Client’s responsibility to assign the specific Location access to each User in the Users Module Item within the Administration Module.
      Pick Lists – Most pick lists can be maintained in the application by the System Administrators in the Administration Module or each specific Module. There are some pick lists that are Location specific, and others that are Module specific. It is the client’s responsibility to manually maintain these pick lists and assign them to the appropriate Locations and Modules after the initial upload during Implementation.
      Reports and Dashboards – Administrators have the responsibility of building their own custom Reports and Dashboards for the metrics of their choice. The AIC Support Team can assist with training the Client on how to build new Reports and Dashboards through a working session via webinar.
      Training – AIC offers continual complimentary user training as well as unlimited support and assistance.
