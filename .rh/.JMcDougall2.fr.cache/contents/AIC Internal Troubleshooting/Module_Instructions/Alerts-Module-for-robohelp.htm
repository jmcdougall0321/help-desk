    Alerts Module Overview
    In the Alerts Module, you are able to set up multiple alerts across all Incident Types and Modules.
    
    Depending on the Module chosen, different alert types become available to set up.
    
      For most alert types to go out, the Responsible Role for each User needs to be selected for that Module. This is done at the User Profile Level.
      There are Supervisor/Admin Alerts that give Users the ability to filter and select the recipients that the alert will go out.
