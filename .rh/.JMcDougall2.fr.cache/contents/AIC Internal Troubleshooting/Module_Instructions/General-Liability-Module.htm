    General Liability Module Overview
  
  
    The General Liability Module is an extension of our Incident Management suite. This Module allows for quick entry of streamlined data, automated email alerts and messaging, and reporting capabilities of GL Claims.
    In this Module you will enter of the information that you have gathered regarding a General Liability Incident. General Liability shares a common user interface with our other Incident Management Modules. When adding or editing a record there will be a series of tabs across the top of the incident form that will contain required data fields to save or maintain the record and a series of tabs across the bottom of the incident form for collecting additional information or attachments.
     
  
  
    General Liability Module Item:
    Within the General Liability Module Item you will see a dynamic search and display grid showing all previously entered incidents in the General Liability Module. Our search grid is unique in that by selecting the heading at the top of each column you can sort the records alphabetically or by date in the column selected. You can also search for a specific record using multiple columns to narrow down your search. Our system also supports wild card searches by putting a % symbol in front of and behind the partial word you have entered (ex: %Diego%).
