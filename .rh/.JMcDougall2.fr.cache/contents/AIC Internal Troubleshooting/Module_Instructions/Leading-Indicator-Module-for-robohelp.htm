    The client can build a library of Leading Indicators that they can use to build scorecards. Once a scorecard has been established, it can be assigned to Locations by Organization Level, Location or Location Group and/or it can be assigned to individual users of the application.
    Responsible individuals at the location level will receive a monthly email that can be used to update their data directly from a hyperlink in the email without having to log into the application.
     
    
      Data will be entered Monthly, however goals can be evaluated:
        
          Monthly
          Quarterly
          Yearly
        
      
    
     
  
  
    
      
      In addition, reminder alerts can be setup and sent to vested parties for the locations they have access to when data is not entered by a certain day of the month.
        From a tracking standpoint, we have provided two options:
      
      Report Builder-Case List Report-Which will allow a user to build a report extracting the raw data entered into the application each month and schedule it for automated delivery
        
          This report can be exported as a PDF, Excel, CSV, or RTF
        
      
      Dashboard-Setup the leading indicator scorecards on the dashboard to track the number of locations that have met their goals for a given time frame.
