    The Complaints Module is part of our Incident Management suite. Within this Module you are able to report on any internal/external Complaints you have created and print a short report for any of the records within this Module.
     
    In this Module you have the ability to track any time/cost associated with a Complaint as well as attach files/supporting documentation, assign corrective/preventative actions that are enforced through email alerts, utilize incident investigative capabilities (unsafe act, unsafe condition, etc.), and more.
     
  
  
    Complaints Module Item:
     
    
    Within the Complaints Module Item you will see a dynamic search and display grid showing all previously entered incidents in the Complaints Module. What is unique about our search grid is that by selecting the heading at the top of each column, you can sort the records alphabetically or by date in the column selected. You can also search for a specific record using multiple columns to narrow down your search. Our system also supports wild card searches by putting a % symbol in front of and behind the partial word you have entered (ex: %Diego%).
