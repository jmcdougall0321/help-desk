    Overview
     
    This document outlines the steps in setting up a Leveled scoring type audit.
     
    Important Notes:
     
    
      Each question added to the audit will be assigned a level. This is done in the weight field on the question input form. The weight is the assigned level for the question.
         
      
      The audit score will be the highest level that is successfully completed.
         
      
      For example, if an audit has 5 levels, the user misses one question on Level 2, but passes Levels 1, 3, 4 and 5 with correct answers, the final score is Level “1” because the user did not pass Level 2.
    
  
  
     
    Step 1:
    
      Go to the Evaluation Module, Setup module item.
      Select the “Add” button on the Evaluation Setup screen.
    
     
  
  
    
     
    Step 2:
    
      
        
          The Properties Input Form will open.
          Enter the Evaluation Name.
          Select “Leveled” from the Scoring Type dropdown.
          Select the desired Number of Levels for your audit, anywhere from 2 to 10.
        
      
    
  
  
    
    Step 3:
    
      Go to the Answer Format mini tab and click on “Format”. This will launch the Response Format form.
      Enter your Answer values and
        %. This is the answer set that your end user will see when answering the evaluation.
        
          In this example, the user will select either Yes or No for each audit question.
          If Yes is selected, they will receive 100% credit for the question. If No is selected, they will receive 0% credit for the question.
        
      
    
    
    Step 4:
    
      Check the “Required Comment” box if you want your user to be required to enter a comment for each question.
      Click OK to save your response format.
    
     
  
  
    
     
    Step 5
    
      The values entered on the response format form will now appear on the Answer Format mini tab.
        
      
      
        Step 6
        Questions can be classified for reporting purposes.
      
      On the Question Classification mini tab, click “Add”.
      The Class Input Form will open. Enter the “Classification” and “Description” then click “OK”
      You have the ability to add multiple question classifications for your audit.
      To save your audit setup, click “Save and Close”.
         
        Step 7
      
      From the Evaluation Setup screen, select the newly added audit and then click on the “Setup Questions” button.
        
        
        Step 8
      
      The Evaluation Setup form will open. This is where you will set up the structure of your audit as well as the individual audit questions.
      To add folders, or sections, to your audit, click on the “New Folder” button.
      The Folder form will open, enter the name of your folder then click “OK”.
         
        Step 9
      
      After you have added the desired folders, you will then begin adding your audit questions.
      Select the folder where you want your question to appear and then click on the “New Question” button.
        
        Step 10
      
      
        When the question form opens, enter your question text.
      
      
        Next you will want to select the “Weight” of the question. This is the LEVEL for the particular question.
      
      The values that appear in the Weight dropdown will be the number of Levels you selected when initially setting up your audit.
        Step 11
        
          The Class dropdown will display those Question Classifications that you entered when setting up your audit.
          Select the desired Class, then click “Save and Close”.
             
            Note: The question classification is for reporting purposes only and does not impact the audit score in any way.
            
          
          
            Step 12
          
          Continue building out the audit questions, assigning each question the desired weight (level).
        
      
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Step 13
    
      The user will complete the audit, selecting the appropriate answer from the Auditor Score dropdown.
        Step 14
        
          To view the score for your leveled audit, go to the Report Center Module, Report Center module item.
          Under the Evaluation category, select Work Plan Score Sheet.
             
             
             
             
             
             
            Step 14
          
          The audit is scored based on the answers entered for each level of the audit.
          For example, if the location answered “Yes” for all Level 1 questions, but answered “No” for at least one Level 2 question, the location’s score would be “Level 1”.
          The score is the highest level that the location successfully completed.
