    Property Damage Module Overview
    The Property Damage Module is part of our Incident Management suite. Within this Module you are able to report on the Property Damage records you have created and print a short report for any of the records within this Module.
    In this Module you will enter all of the information that you have gathered regarding a Property Damage incident. As you will see all of the modules and module items have a common user interface. When adding or editing a record there will be a series of tabs across the top of the incident form that will contain required data fields to save or maintain the record and a series of tabs across the bottom of the incident form for collecting additional information or attachments.
    Within the Property Damage Module Item you will see a dynamic search and display grid showing all previously entered incidents in the Property Damage Module. What is unique about our search grid is that by selecting the heading at the top of each column, you can sort the records alphabetically or by date in the column selected. You can also search for a specific record using multiple columns to narrow down your search. Our system also supports wild card searches by putting a % symbol in front of and behind the partial word you have entered (ex: %Diego%).
