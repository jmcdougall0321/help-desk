    People Module Item
    Allows Users to Add, Edit, Delete, Send to Excel, and Search People within the application.
      ‎Creating a Person account will automatically create a User account for the Person being
      ‎added. The User account must then be given a Username and Password for the Person to have
      ‎access to the site. Creating a Person Account and then creating an additional user account for
        ‎the same Person would cause a duplicate to be made within the system.
