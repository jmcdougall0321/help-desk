  Duplicate form
  Good Afternoon,
  We are having a handful of users that are receiving an error message when they attempt to edit a corrective action from either the activity calendar or from within an event module.
  Attached are screenshots from one users that sees this message.
  "Sequence contains more than one element"
  I have asked these users to clear the cache and Flush DNS, but they are still receiving this error message.
  I am able to open the corrective action and update the necessary information on my computer.
  This happened in November. I believe it had something to do with the security in the profile.
  This user has the following profile: Vegetation Manager Recordkeeper.
  Let me know if you need any additional information
   
   
  
  I was able to track down the issue causing the error message.  It was due to duplicate forms in the profile security for the profile you provided.  I have removed the duplicate and will put it a task to have and additional duplicates removed from existing profiles.  But if you receive any reports of this moving forward I would look in the profile security for duplicate entries.
