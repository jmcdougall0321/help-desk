    I am having trouble submitting this to our TPA. Can you help?
     
    
    In reviewing on this end, it looks like the Accident Type (aka Injury Event) dropdown which is found on the What-How Tab is "Surface contacted with irritating substances". This value was added after the initial mapping of the pick list values to GB, therefore it is not mapped to one of the TPA values behind the scenes. Note: The system will not allow submission until mapped to ensure proper alignment once loading into GB
     
    
    I have listed the company values below; once you confirm which GB value you wish to map this to I will get a ticket in with our development team ASAP.
