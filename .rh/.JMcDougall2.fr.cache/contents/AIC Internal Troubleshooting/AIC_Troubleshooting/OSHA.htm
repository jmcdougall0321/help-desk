    We are wondering because we just pulled together the OSHA logs for our buildings and noticed a couple things… what is the logic behind the scenes with regards to these 2 sets of questions?  We found that because they default mainly to N/A that they ended up not being on the logs at all.  We had to change all of the bullets points to either Yes or No for it to show up.  Is it possible for them to change the default answer to “NO” instead of “N/A” on all these questions?
