    Is there a way to pick more than one field in the below? We do not want all incidents as we only need injury, GL and vehicle. It will not allow me to choose more than one from the drop down.
     
     
     
    To achieve this, I recommend choosing all incidents as the data to represent then filtering the incident types in the indicator to the ones you want to include. Here are some quick steps below to achieve this:
     
    
      Select ‘data to represent’ = all incidents
        
      
      Click on the filter criteria
        
      
      Choose tab = general details, field = incident types
      Click on the additional parameters
        
      
      Uncheck ‘select all’ and check the boxes for the incident types you would like to include
        
      
      Save and close
