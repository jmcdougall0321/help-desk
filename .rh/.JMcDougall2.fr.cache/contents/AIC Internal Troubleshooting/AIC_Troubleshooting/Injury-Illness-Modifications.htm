    The team is reviewing 3 Injury/Illness lists.
    Accident Type
      ‎Agency/Source of Injury
      ‎Nature of Injury.
    Before we make any changes to the lists, we have a few questions:
    By making a few options Inactive, will it affect incidents currently in the system?
      ‎Could we submit AIC a list of options that we are considering making inactive?
    By making a few options Inactive, will it affect incidents currently in the system?
    
      By marking a pick list item as inactive, it removes it from the list so that the option is no longer available to be chosen when entering incidents. You can still report of the historical data as it would remain intact. I would also take caution in deactivate picklist values that are required for your claim submission as this would cause issue for your end users when trying to submit claims.
        Could we submit AIC a list of options that we are considering making inactive?
      
      If this list is rather long and extensive, you can absolutely submit a file in excel format containing the picklist items you would like removed. I would recommend you separate them out in different tabs so that we know which picklist you are referring to in the system. I’ve attached a template for you to utilize if needed.
    
     
     
     
    Thank you for the feedback.  After further review, the only concern we have is with Accident Type.  I don’t see where I can make changes to (Accident Type) in the Administration Module.
     
     
    The Accident Type picklist is populated by the Injury Event module item in the Administration module.  
    
    Let me know if you have any other questions!
