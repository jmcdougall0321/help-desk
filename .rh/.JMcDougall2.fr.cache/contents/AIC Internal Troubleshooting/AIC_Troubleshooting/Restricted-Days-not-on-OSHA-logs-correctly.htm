    The number of restricted days is not adding/transferring correctly to the OSHA 300 and 300A
     
     
    Thank you for your email. We are looking into this and will follow up with additional details as they become available.
     
    Thank you for your patience. After reviewing the incident data and the OSHA 300 log for the Tacoma location, the number of days (Away from work + On job transfer or restriction) is maxing at 180 days for each incident.
    Please let us know if you have any further questions!
     
    Just curious, Is this per OSHA that logs max out at 180 days? In case it comes up again, might be best for the team to understand.
     
    
     
    Counting days:
    
      Begin counting days away/restricted the day after the injury/illness occurred.
      Include weekends, holidays, etc. (whether EE scheduled to work or not)
