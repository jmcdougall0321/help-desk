    It looks like there is a custom alert that was created by you yesterday for New Incident or Injury at the Mt. Pleasant location that is active. The incident 2019-096 was entered as a near miss and triggered the new incident alert that is set up to be sent to you since you created the alert. If you do not need or want to be notified for Near Misses we simply need to filter out Near Miss Module in the alert. If you don’t want to receive the alert altogether we can create a “Fake User” to be the creator of the alert which will remove you from the distribution list. Let me know if you have any other questions.
    
     
    Well…I created so I could delete his old one that was sending to everyone. Fixing the mess so to speak. So can we just remove me altogether for this one and the Sun Prairie one? In the future each site would create their own. Would this be the same for any other I create for the organization? I am not sure I want to get them all and that part was not clear to me that even if I don’t include me in the distro list I get it because I created it. What about if they copy one? Does it include the original creator or create is as a “new one” and only send to the new creator? May be can have a call later today when I am out of this meeting after 5 (I am in Chicago) my time.
     
     
    Anytime an alert is created the logged in user will automatically inherit that alert and will become a participant. If you do not wish to receive notifications for all the alerts you’ve created, best practice is to create a default “dummy” account. This would then allow you to login through the dummy account and create alerts without having to receive notifications for every single one. AIC can also update the created user of your current active alerts to the dummy account once it has been created. You will remain an owner of these alerts so that you can edit them as needed through your normal administrator account.
     
    An example of a dummy account is shown in the screenshot below. You would want to make sure that this account has access to all locations so that you can assign alerts out to your divisions accordingly. This can be accomplished by applying an Administrator profile to this user record. You would also want to insert a fake email address.
    
    Once the account is setup, I can create a development task to have the alerts that you created reassigned.
     
    When an alert is COPIED the person who copies the alert becomes the creator and the creator of the original alert would not inherit the notifications.
