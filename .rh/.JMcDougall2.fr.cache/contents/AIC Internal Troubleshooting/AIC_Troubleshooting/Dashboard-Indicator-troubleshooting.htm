    Is there a way to copy a dashboard indicator as a starting point for a variation, or do I have to start from the ground up?
    There are two ways you can copy scorecard indicators, more below. 
    Option 1: Add the indicator to the indicators library, once added here it can be applied to any dashboard as many times as needed.
    1.    Navigate to the dashboard module > indicators module item.
    
    2.    Select add.
    
    3.    Create the indicator desired.
    4.    Next, navigate to your dashboard and go to ‘edit indicators’ to add a new indicator. 
    5.    You can now drag and drop the indicator you created as many times as you wish.
    6.    Then you can make any needed edits to each indicator by exiting the ‘edit indicators’, clicking the menu (hamburger) icon on the indicator and selecting edit.
    Option 2: Copy Button
     
    1.    Within your dashboard, click the menu (hamburger) icon of the indicator you wish to clone.
    2.    Select copy.
    3.    Give the indicator a new name and click ok.
    4.    Then the clone will appear, any needed edits can be made.
