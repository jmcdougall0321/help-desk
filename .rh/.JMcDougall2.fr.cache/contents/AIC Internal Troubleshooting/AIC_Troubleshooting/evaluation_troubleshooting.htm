    Having trouble again with the 2nd Qtr. Assessment,  the score box not highlighted so will not let me input an answer. Ive tried both Google Chrome and Firefox. Please assist.
     
     
    Is this only happening to Joe’s user account or have other uses with his Profile access also reported the same issue?
     
    Thanks!
     
    This is the first I’ve heard of it.  Everything is working fine for me
     
    After further review, it appears as though Joe’s account is the only user associated to this profile that seems to be having this issue. I have created Task [28562] to have our development team look further into this. I will follow up with additional details as they become available
