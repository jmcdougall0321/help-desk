  
    Review/Approval Tab
    Can the Review process be automatic once a preparer has entered a record
    in the Injury/Illness module?  For example:
     
    Preparer enters an injury record
    Click Save and Close
    Record (or email alert) is sent to assigned Reviewer for that location
    Record is not made visible (or published) until Reviewer Concurs with the
    record
     
    Thank you for your email. At this time, the Review and Approval process is triggering by submitting the incident through the mini tab. The reviewers need to be selected in the mini tab before the Submit for Review button can be selected, as there could potentially be different reviewers and approvers at a given location.
    
    Since this process has a series of steps that need to be completed before the incident can be submitted to be reviewed, saving and closing the incident would not trigger the notifications as the system would not know who to send the notifications to.
     
    Let me know if you have any other questions.
