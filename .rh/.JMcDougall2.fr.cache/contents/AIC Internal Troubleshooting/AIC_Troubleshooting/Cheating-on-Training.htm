    I can't seem to edit the "Require e-Learner to view content in predefined sequence" or anything else that is greyed out on these classes in the Courses view.  Is it an ownership issue?  Can you please help me to get this solved?

        ‎This was a pre packed SCORM course uploaded by the EMCOR team the Require e-Learner to view content in predefined sequence does not apply because the rules/parameters of the course are built into the provided SCORM package.
    Thanks for the clarification.
