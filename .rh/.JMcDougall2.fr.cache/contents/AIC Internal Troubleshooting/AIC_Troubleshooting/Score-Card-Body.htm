    I am working to create a score card which shows by body part, but am having some diffuculties:
    1. The chart only shows a small size.
      ‎2. The body parts are not being identified
      ‎3. The number of inuries does not appear to be correct.
     
    The reason you are seeing less cases in the Body Part Indicator than in your Injury and Illness Module is due to a few of the cases not having Body Parts selected in the What-How Tab. If they do not have any body parts selected, the Indicator does not have any data to pull back and the incident will not show on the indicator.
     
     
    As for the incidents that are populating with the Body Parts are showing as not mapped: it looks like none of the Body Parts are mapped for the Dashboard.
     
    To map these Body Parts you will complete the following:
    
      Go to Scorecards Module > Body Part Indicator Mapping > Select a body part (note: you will need to do this for all body parts you wish to be mapped) > Click Map Body Part Grid Column > Select the Left Side Mapping and Right Side Mapping > Save and Close
         
        
         
        In regards to the Indicator showing up too small, this is due to the original layout selected when created the Tab.
         
      
      Visit your dashboard > Click Wesley’s Dashboard > Edit Tabs > I clicked the (+) to add a new tab, the one outlined in red is the layout you have currently
