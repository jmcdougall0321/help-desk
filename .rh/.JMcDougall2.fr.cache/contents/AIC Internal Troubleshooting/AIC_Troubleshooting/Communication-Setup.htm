    the ability to send out an email to a group is possible within the Insight’s Communication mini tab. However, in reviewing your Profile access, it doesn’t appear that you have access to the Communication Setup module item that is needed in order to accomplish this. I’ve copied Jarrett Quoyle on this email that can assist you in gaining access to this module item.
     
    Once you have been granted access to the Communication Setup module item (found within the Administration module) please follow the steps I’ve outlined below to create your USG specific group(s). Please note that you will need to set this up for each location.
     
    
      Navigate to the Administration module
      Select the Communication Setup module item
      Locate the location(s) that you wish to create a group for.
        
          Select to highlight it in the grid and click the EDIT grid button
        
      
    
    
    
      You will first need to add your list of recipients; there are two ways to accomplish this; you can add them manually or use the Upload Wizard.
        
          Adding manually:
            
              Click the Add button on the Communication Setup Form
                
                  Manually type in the recipient’s name and email and click OK
                  Continue to add as many recipients as needed
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
     
     
    
     
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  Once you have your recipients, you can then create a group. On the same Communication Setup Form click the Groups tab.
                    
                      Click the Add button
                      Title your group by inserting it into the GROUP NAME text box
                      Begin to select the persons you want in this group from your Available Recipients and move them over the Selected Recipients box
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
    Once you’ve got all of your recipients, click Save and Close
    
      
        
          Using the Upload Wizard – Useful for bulk upload of recipients
            
              On the Communication Setup input form click the Upload Wizard button; this will launch a new window
              Follow the instructions on this Upload Wizard:
                
                  Open the Excel Template
                  Enter the Recipient name in column A and emails in column B
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
    
      Copy and paste the data in your excel template and be sure to INCLUDE the headers (Recipient Name / e-mail address) - then click the Retrieve Recipients button
    
    
    
      Next, click Add Recipients
    
    
     
    Once you have your recipients, you can then create a group. On the same Communication Setup Form click the Groups tab.
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      Click the Add button
                      Title your group by inserting it into the GROUP NAME text box
                      Begin to select the persons you want in this group from your Available Recipients and move them over the Selected Recipients box
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
    Now that you’ve configured your Communication Group, you will be able to send emails directly to these recipients from the Communication mini tab on the Insights input form. When you open up the mini tab, you can either send the email to the entire group, or select the “Show recipients” button and choose select individuals to receive the email.
