    The “Evaluation: Scores by Organization” report does not have the functionality to be in Excel/CSV format, and cannot be scheduled for automated delivery. However, with the Build Report Module, you have the ability to customize this report to your likely and schedule this for automated delivery. Please see below for more detail:
     
    
      Report Center Module > Report Builder Module Item > ADD Grid Button > Report Category – ALL INCIDENTS/CORRECTIVE ACTIONS > Report Type – Location Summary - NEW
