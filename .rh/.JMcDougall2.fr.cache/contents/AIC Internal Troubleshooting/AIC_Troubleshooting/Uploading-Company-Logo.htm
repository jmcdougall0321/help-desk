      How do I upload our Logo?
        
          Logos can be uploaded through the Administration module  Report Logo Module item
            
              Simply click the ADD grid button and upload your PDF logo directly from your desktop
                
              
            
          
        
      
      How do I change time zone for Pumpco?
        
          The AIC database will always appear in PST. AT this time, you cannot change the time zone reflected in AIC.
        
      
      Is there a manual that is searchable when I have simple questions like the above?
        
          There is a Tutorials module item within the tools module that has a number of useful tutorials on various items throughout the database. We don’t necessarily have a manual that encompasses everything. When you navigate to the Tools module item, you can search within the headers to locate the type of instruction or guidance that you are looking for.
