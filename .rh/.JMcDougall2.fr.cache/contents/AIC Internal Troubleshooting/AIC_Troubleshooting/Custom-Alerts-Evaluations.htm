    We are not seeing a way to set an alert for the Evaluation module for "Responsible Party- Corrective Action". As we are able to assign corrective actions from the evaluations module, we will need the ability for alerts to be sent when an action is assigned. Can you please turn on this capability for the Evaluation module?

    I apologize for the delayed response! I am currently looking into the Evaluation Responsible Party Corrective Action and I will be following up with you shortly ðŸ˜Š

    You can create a Custom Alert > Corrective Action > Responsible Party Alert for Evaluations by filtering the Custom Alert. I have provided steps and screenshots below:
    
      
        
          
            
              Alert Body Template Main Tab
            
          
          
            
              Filter Criteria Main Tab
            
          
          
            
              Tab > Corrective Action Details
            
          
          
            
              Field > Alert Module
            
          
          
            
              Select the Additional Parameters [â€¦]
            
          
          
            
              Uncheck all Modules Except for Evaluations
