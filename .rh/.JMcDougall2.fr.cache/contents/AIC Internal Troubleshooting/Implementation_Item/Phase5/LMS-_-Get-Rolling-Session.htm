    Picklists
    
      Certificates, Agencies, Categories etc. A picklist template can be sent to Administrators to complete and return to AIC. These should be agreed upon by all Administrators and then Profile Controlled so that only Administrators have access to updating if needed. This will keep the Training Module consistent.

      Default Courses: There are several default courses provided by AIC. AOC can go through the courses to determine which they will be using.

    Training

          Sessions usually last approximately 1 hour, however we can accommodate as many as needed.
