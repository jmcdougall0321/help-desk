      ‎The AIC Approach
     
    Our approach is to make your implementation as uneventful as possible.
     
    To do this, we rely on our track record of large scale successful implementations, detailed project documentation and good communication with the client and implementation team.
     
    As part of the implementation we will provide:
    
      Project Documentation for integration points; Employee File, Employee Hours File, etc.
      Excel based templates for defining pick list values, with defaults.
      Excel based templates for the upload of historical data.
      Environment for reviewing loaded data.
        
          As your Organization Structure and Location Data are loaded…review it!
          As your pick list values are pre-populated…review it!!
          As your historical data is loaded…review it!!
          As part of the training process, we will create a copy of this environment for training your users.
        
      
      Web based portal, https://projects.appsint.com for tracking all implementation specific supporting documentation, tracking action items with estimated completion dates (all enforced by automated email alerts and messaging), and status updates on the implementation. All implementation team members, both AIC and client, have access to the site and are encouraged to contribute.
      Weekly “Touch Base” Meetings for discussing action item status, addressing questions from the group and to identify any impediments to the implementation.
        
          “Touch Base” Meetings are held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. The group will agree upon a time and a meeting notice will be provided.
        
      
    
     
    Many of the action items happen in parallel. AIC has developed several tools that allow for the quick upload of project management data. For this reason it is important that data be provided in the exact format requested for quicker turnaround times.
     
    Next Stop…the GET ROLLING Meeting!!!
    
      ‎Implementation Tools - AIC Project Site
     
    As part of the implementation process, we also provide a web based tool for tracking all projects - supporting documentation as well as action items. Both the (Client Name) Implementation Team and the AIC Support Team will use the projects site to share necessary documents. All (Client Name) Implementation Team members will have access to the projects site.
     
    https://projects.appsint.com/
     
    You will be provided with login credentials (user name and password) for the Projects Site.
     
    After logging in, you will be able to see the list of outstanding projects, action items and completion status. You will also be able to access the documentation needed for the project from the Files mini tab.
    
    Compatibility Settings
     
    For optimal compatibility with your Application and the Projects Site, you will need to ensure your Internet Browser Settings are configured correctly. Located on the Projects Site within the Corporate Document Library, you will find documents outlining the settings that need to be updated on your browser to experience the applications full functionality.

      All [Client Name] implementation team members will have access to this site.
      The Project Site will keep track of all Action Items in one centralized portal for AIC and [Client Name] to streamline the Implementation progress.
    
     
     
     
    
      ‎ 
    Touch Base Meetings
     
    As part of the Implementation Process, we will schedule reoccurring Touch Base Meetings on a weekly basis. These meetings typically last anywhere from 15-30 minutes, and are used to go over the status of the Implementation and answer any questions you have. Touch Base Meetings can be scheduled weekly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
     
    Prior to the first Touch Base Meeting, we must have your Database created. The following items are needed in order for AIC to create your database:
     
    
      Customized Site URL
      Application Name
      Company Logo
      Languages chosen
      Alert Details
    
     
    AIC also requires that you provide your Organization Structure and Locations prior to the first Touch Base Meeting. Everything in the system is tied back to the Location, therefore it is important to have this in place when beginning the Implementation. You can upload this to the Files mini tab on the Project Site.
     
    We will work with your team to find a date and time each week that will work with your schedule. Everyone who is actively involved in the Implementation will be invited to join via WebEx Webinar.
     
    
      ‎ 
    Organization Structure/Location Data
     
    The Organization Structure and Location List are key elements within the application, as all of the data ties back to the location. After the initial upload, we will cover how to maintain the Organization Structure through tools provided in the application in the Administrator Training.
     
    The documents for this can be found on our projects website at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library.
     
    The template contains two worksheets:
    
      Locations to Load – Please use the corresponding worksheet to provide a list of your work locations to be uploaded in the application.
      Org Structure Example – The system will not only store your locations but allows you to map out your Organization Structure as well. This worksheet is an example of an Org Structure to aid in the documentation process.
    
     
    Template Snapshot
    
    Organization/Location data must be delivered in the template provided.

      ‎ 
     
    PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION
    
      ‎ 
    Employee File (Demographic) Feed
     
    The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System is an open platform and provides the ability to “load” employee demographic information from an HRIS or Employee Demographic System on an ongoing basis. With this in place, data entry is streamlined as there is no need to manually enter employees into the application.
     
    The document that explains the secure process for bringing over employee data on a periodic basis can be found at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library. This document includes details on:
    
      File Format (Fixed Width or CSV)
      File Naming
      Record Inclusion
      File Encryption (Required)
      Transmission Frequency
      FTP/SFTP Information
      Online Training – E Learner Usernames Generation
         
        Note: Employees can be manually added to the application through the interface provided.
         
        Data Integrity
         
        To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements.
         
        People Role Assignments
         
        Role assignments are available for employees as part of the upload process. These can be assigned individually or by groups/profile levels. Each user can have as many or as few roles as needed.
         
        Assignments can be made at the time of adding employees or after exploration of the application.
         
        By selecting a specific role that employee will automatically populate into any drop downs or pick lists that requires a responsible person for that location.
        
          ‎Employee Hours Feed
         
        The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System is an open platform and provides the ability to “load” employee hours worked demographic information from an HRIS or Payroll System on an ongoing basis. With this in place, data entry is streamlined as there is no need to manually enter this data into the application. This is information is used for Federal Compliance Reports, Frequency/Severity Rate Calculations and data normalization.
         
        The document that explains the secure process for bringing over employee hours worked data on a periodic basis can be found at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library. This document includes details on:
      
      File Format (Fixed Width or CSV)
      File Naming
      Record Inclusion
      File Encryption (Required)
      Transmission Frequency
      FTP/SFTP Information
    
     
    There are four options for the upload of Employee Hours worked data based on the needs of the Organization:
    
      Employee Hours Worked by Location by Month (most commonly used)
      Employee Hours Worked by Location – Department by Month
      Employee Hours Worked by Location by Day
        
          Recommended if looking to report by Fiscal Year.
        
      
      Employee Hours Worked by Employee
    
     
    Note: Employee Hours can be manually added to the application if needed.
     
    Data Integrity
     
    To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements.
     
     
    
      ‎ 
    Automated Feeds
    Acknowledgements - Exceptions
     
    As part of the automated employee and employee hours file transmission process we send automated e-mails to inform team members of the upload status.
     
    We break exception into three types which are communicated via email to your designated team members.
     
    Emails consist of a summary PDF and detail excel file:
    
      Type 1 – No File Received as Scheduled
      Type 2 – File Received but were unable to process. In this case, a detailed reason is provided.
      Type 3 – File was processed successfully. Email provides:
        
          Number of records in File
          Number of records Added
          Number of records Updated
          Number of records that were not processed
          Any exceptions
        
      
    
     
    Moving forward you will receive these emails directly from alerts@appsint.com.
     
    As part of the implementation process we will identify the recipients and the types of exceptions they should receive via email.
    
      ‎ 
    Incident Management Solution - Pick List Validation Tables
     
    Within the application we standardize and streamline data entry through pick lists (pre-defined values) instead of having the end user type in the values. This also ensures consistent data for accurate reporting. For many of the items you’ll find that there are default values for you to review, modify and send back for upload. The maintenance of these values going forward can be done within the application through the point and click user interface. There are several items that we strongly suggest be identified up front. The remaining items can be defined as users add records to the application.
     
    AIC provides default or example values for the majority of the picklists in the application.  A template for defining and uploading picklists can be found on the projects website at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library.
     
    
    
      ‎ 
    Case Numbering
     
    Within the application, each Incident that is entered is assigned a case number to use as an identifier. Below are the available options for Case Numbering.
     
    User Generated: This will be a free form text box for the User to manually enter any case number of your choice.
     
    Auto Generated: A Case Number will be automatically assigned to each Incident by the system.
    
      If choosing to use the system-generated case numbering, these can be generated as a sequence per Location, or on a global scale.
         
        
          By Location – Each Location will have their own sequence. Example:
            
              San Diego Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003
              New York Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003
              Available Formats: (YYYY=Year, L=Location Code, M=Month, ###=Consecutive numbering)
                
                  YYYY-L-###
                  YYYY-L-####
                  MLYY###
                  YYYY-###
                     
                  
                
              
            
          
          Global: The case numbers will be unique, regardless of which location the incident was created for. Example:
        
      
    
    
      San Diego Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003
      New York Location: 2016-004, 2016-005, 2016-006
    
     
    Please select which format of Case Numbering works best for your Organization prior to entering incidents into the application.
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    
      ‎ 
    Custom Fields
     
    One of the newest enhancements in the application is the ability to add custom fields on the General Details Tab within the Incident Input Forms. (Injury and Illness, Vehicle, General Liability, and Other). This is specific to the needs of your Organization, and can be customized per Incident Type. These can be added in the form of a Picklist, single line free-form text, multi-line text box, point and click date and time drop-downs, and check boxes.
     
    All of the custom fields added will be data that will flow to the Report Center and KPI Dashboards.
     
     
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    
      ‎ 
    OGP Event Mobile App
     
    The OGP Event Mobile App allows you and your team to enter an Event (aka Incident across all types such as Injury and Illness, Near Miss, First Aid, Spill, Property Damage, Vehicle Incident etc.) both Online (connected to WIFI or cellular connection) and Offline (without WIFI or cellular connection).
     
    The OGP Event App is available in both the Apple Store and Google Play Store for free download.
     
    
      ‎
    Users
     
    In order to log in to the application, users must be set up with usernames and passwords, and given access to locations/facilities.
     
    A template is used to load your users into the system. You will need to provide their First Name, Last Name, Employee Number, Email Address, and Security Profile.
     
    The template for this can be found at https://projects.appsint.com/, Corporate Document Library, using the username and password provided.
     
    Usernames and Passwords will initially be set to whatever is to the left of the @ sign in the user's email address. Users will be able to change their passwords once they log in.
     
    After we have loaded your users in the system, you will need to edit the user records to assign the appropriate locations/facilities to the users.
     
    Template Snapshot
     
    
     
     
    
      ‎Initial Security Profiles
     
    Security Profiles are created and assigned to users with the same system functionality access needs. Typically we roll out with two user profiles and base our training sessions on them.
     
    Going forward these can be modified and new profiles added to meet the needs of the Organization.
     
    Profile 1 – Administrator (access to all system functionality with additional admin functions)
    
      
        
          Adding/Editing Locations
          Modifying the Organization Structure
          Adding/Editing Pick Lists
          User Setup
          Security Profiles for Users
          Alerts setup
        
      
    
     
    Profile 2 – Recordkeeper
    
      
        
          Adding/Editing Incident Records
          Entering Employee Hours
          Corrective Actions/Activity Calendar
          Basic Reporting including OSHA reports.
          Conducting Audits

    PHASE 4 IMPLEMENTATION
    
      ‎ 
    AIC Training Program
     
    Once the preceding items have been received and loaded to your database, we will schedule user (Recordkeeper) and Administrator webcast training sessions.
     
    As part of the Implementation, AIC offers its clients one Onsite Training session at no charge and unlimited Training sessions via the web using WebEx. Additional Onsite Training sessions can be scheduled at the client’s request. AIC also offers its clients various Tutorials, Recorded Training Sessions and Training Materials to assist with Training and Implementation.
     
    Session Details
    
      Sessions are done via the Web using Citrix WebEx and Teleconference Call in Number
      Sessions are 60 Minutes in length with time for questions
      Sessions will focus on current functionality only
      Sessions are recorded for future playback and refresher training opportunities
      A Training Agenda containing material to be covered will be provided in advance of each session
      The different types of Training Sessions conducted will include Administrator Training and End-User or “Recordkeeper” Training.
    
     
    The training provided is based on the application as it currently exists.
    Although we welcome feedback from our users, change requests are not addressed in the training sessions due to time constraints.
     
    [Client] Representative – Training Session Responsibilities
    
      Confirm end user profiles.
      Provide each user their usernames and passwords.
      Provide the URL for both the production and training sites.
      Kick off each training session by giving an overview of company specific expectations and requirements.
    
     
    Important Note: AIC offers continual complimentary User Training Sessions for all Solutions that you are currently licensing. Each Training Session will be roughly an hour long, however we can schedule as many sessions as you would like until your team is comfortable with the functionality of the application!
     
     
    
      ‎ 
    [CLIENT NAME] Training Overview
     
    Overview
     
    Training sessions provided by the AIC Implementation Team, will not only cover the “How To” of navigating the system, but more importantly the company specific requirements in regards to use of the application. A member of the CLIENT NAME Team will be needed on each session to cover the company specific requirements for users attending the session.
     
    Below is an overview of the various training sessions to be held for CLIENT NAME. This list is not all inclusive. Training will customized and held as needed both before and after system go live.

    Additional Training Sessions [Customize for Client based on licensed solutions]
     
    Additional Administrator and End User (Recordkeeper) sessions will be held as needed for the roll out of the following solutions:
     
    
      Observation Module
      Evaluation Module
      Regulatory Compliance Module
      Training/LMS
    
     
    Reports/Alerts/Scorecards/Action Items available for each module will be covered during that module’s training session.
     
    The number of Training Sessions are dependent upon the number of initial Security Profiles configured by the client.
    
      ‎ 
    OPTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
     
     
    
      ‎ 
    Historical Data
     
    Uploading your historical data into the application provides great back trend analysis capability and value to the Organization. Although not necessary for roll out, we have the ability to load your historical data to the application using a series of excel based templates. This provides the Organization an opportunity to review, consolidate and “scrub” their historical data if needed. Please identify the types, and sources, of your historical data and notify your AIC Implementation team. We will then provide you with the necessary templates and instructions for upload.
     
    AIC allows for a one-time upload of Historical Data per Module. We recommend gathering all data together prior to providing to AIC. Going forward, you can upload Historical Data manually into the application.
     
    Template Snapshot
     
    
     
     
    Important Notes:
    
      Historical Data is not required for Go-Live, and shouldn’t hold up the rollout process.
      Please allow 3 weeks turnaround time for Historical Data. (1 week to review, one week to upload to Training and verify, one week to upload to Production).
    
    
      ‎ 
    TPA – Claim Submission
     
    The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System provides the ability to submit Claims electronically to a Third Party Administrator. We have the ability to integrate with any TPA for Workers Compensation Claims, Vehicle Liability Claims, and General Liability Claims. This replaces:
    
      Phoning
      Faxing
      Emailing
    
    …and promotes data consistency by eliminating duplicate data entry.
     
    **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER - AIC will NOT add client defined / custom fields to any existing Third Party Administrator (TPA) Claim Submission Electronic Data Integration (EDI). AIC has stringent security requirements as part of our System and Organization Controls (SOC) Report under the SSAE-18 standard audits, which limit AIC in sending anything outside the scope of the current integration. AIC will not do anything that may affect data integrity for our clients.
    **IMPORTANT NOTE - AIC is the first notification to the TPA, not the State. AIC will send the TPA the basic required information in order to file the First Report of Injury (FROI) with the insurance company/TPA. These are regulatory reports and AIC does not want to require anything beyond the basic requirements; based on our experience requiring additional fields may lead users to enter false information in order to get the claim submitted. Many times additional fields (beyond the basic requirements) are not available when the initial claim is entered and submitted to the TPA.
     
    To submit Workers Compensation claims from the application, we will need to work with your TPA to setup the process.
     
    Please send an email to the TPA contact person we will need to work with, introducing AIC so they can be prepared and receptive for us to contact them.

    Leading Indicator Module
     
    The Leading Indicator Module will allow you to build a library of Leading Indicators that can be used to build scorecards.
     
    Once a scorecard has been established, it can be assigned to Locations by Organization Level, Location or Location Group and/or it can be assigned to individual users of the application.
     
    Responsible individuals at the location level will receive a monthly email that can be used to update their data directly from a hyperlink in the email without having to log into the application.
     
    Data will be entered monthly, however goals can be evaluated:
    
      Monthly
      Quarterly
      Yearly
    
     
    In addition, reminder alerts can be setup and sent to vested parties for the locations they have access to when data is not entered by a certain day of the month.
     
    From a tracking standpoint, there are two options:
    
      Report Builder – Case List Report – Which will allow a user to build a report extracting the raw data entered into the application each month and schedule it for automated delivery.
        
          This report can be exported as a PDF, Excel, CSV or RTF.
             
          
        
      
      Dashboard – Setup the leading indicator scorecards on the dashboard to track the number of locations that have met their goals for a given time frame.

    Important Note: We do not schedule Go Live Dates on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or Mondays.
     
    Time estimates are contingent on receiving complete data.
     
     
     
    Ongoing Administrative Responsibility
     
    After the initial implementation of the system the time needed for ongoing maintenance of the application is minimal. Users who have administrator level access have the ability to maintain the following core data within the application.
     
    Organization Structure
     
    As your Org Structure changes, you can use the drag and drop functionality within the application to easily make updates or add additional levels.
    
      The Org Structure controls how the data rolls up for reporting purposes.
      If you move a location within the Org Structure, the data automatically moves with it since data is tied to locations.
    
     
    Locations
     
    Update the application to add any new locations, make them in-active, or closed.
    
      Usually a location will be a physical location.
      Incidents and employees are tied to locations.
      Administrators have the ability to control mapping codes to locations.
    
     
    Users / User Profiles
     
    Setup usernames/passwords for users to login to the application.
    
      Select the locations the users will have access to.
      User access to application functionality is determined by the user “Profile” they are assigned to.
      User Profiles can be modified by administrators.
    
     
    Tools
     
    Once you’ve gone live with the application there are a series of tools available for measuring system usage:
    
      Login History for tracking login attempts; successful and unsuccessful.
      Last Login Date per User
      Automated Email Alerts
      Using the Automated Reports for verifying the type and quality if the data being entered.
    
    As part of the implementation process your Implementation Lead will walk through these tools and make some recommendations on how you may want to use them based on your business processes.
     
    Change Request Sign Off 
     
    Although AIC is able to customize various areas of the system during the implementation process; for any change that will require AIC development work the AIC Discovery Process will be required. This is the full process we adhere to for all changes/enhancements. Depending on the size and scope of the change, this process may take anywhere from a few minutes for a simple label change to several months for a new module. The final product will be a document that will detail development work and associated time and cost. The investment in these services is typically $200.00 per hour (may change at AIC upper management discretion), billed as actual. If you want to proceed with development, we will credit the discovery process fee to your project.
     
    This sign off document indicates the [CLIENT] agrees that custom development will not be requested for a minimum of 90 days after the implementation process is complete and users have been actively entering records into the application.
