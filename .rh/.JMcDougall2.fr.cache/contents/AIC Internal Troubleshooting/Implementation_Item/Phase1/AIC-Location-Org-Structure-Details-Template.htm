              When creating incident records in the application, we auto-generate case numbers. The normal
              sequence is: The Four Digit Year, Sequence Number. The resulting case number looks like: 2012-
              001.We have the ability to include another identifier in the case number, that is the CASE_NUMBER_CODE. This value will appear in the middle of your case number. Example: 2012- SAN-001
            
          
          
            
              Code assigned to each location.
            
          
          
            
              If sending employee and employee hours information electronically, this code will ensure
              incoming employees and employee hours are routed to the correct location.
