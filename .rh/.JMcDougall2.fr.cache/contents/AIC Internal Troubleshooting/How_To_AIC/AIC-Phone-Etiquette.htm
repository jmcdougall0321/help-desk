    You represent AIC every time you answer the phone
    
      Even when you know who is on the other end (Caller ID)
        
          The person on the other end of the line could be a director or vice president and we need to speak to them according
            
              Respect their position (Will serve you well)
              Don’t ever assume anything (Will get you in trouble)
            
          
        
      
      Consistency is key (Not Robotic)
      Always answer the phone with a professional manner
        
          Cannot error on professionalism
        
      
    
    Your goal is to control every call that comes through
    
      Maintain the direction of the call
      Controlling the call helps reduce your anxiety and instills trust in our clients
    
    Each call only has two directions:
    
      Service in Support: Problem or a Fix
        
          If something needs to be fixed you need to get the necessary information from the client so we know exactly what needs to be fixed
            
              
                
                  Create Bug/Task in TFS
                
              
            
          
        
      
      Information: Help in the Application
        
          You need to figure out what they are doing, what Browser they are in, etc. all information Dev. needs to know/information that will help you troubleshoot
          You will go in to investigation mode to help problem solve
          Have them walk you through the steps that they are taking so you know exactly what they are doing and if it’s an issue
            
              Training: If somebody needs to be taught something then you need to find out what it is that they don't understand and you need to work with them to schedule a time so that you can train them in the application
                
                  All about listening to what they want
                  The system isn’t broken – the client isn’t using the application correctly
                  If they need training:
                    
                      Help the Client over the phone
                        
                          Make sure you know what Profile Level they have (Admin)
                            
                              If not Admin – have them contact their Site Admin – they can contact you (AIC) for additional End User Training
                            
                          
                        
                      
                      Provide them dates/times to set up a WebEx for formal Training
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    Every call should end with the customer knowing exactly what's going to happen next and a ticket should be created
    
      Gemini
      TFS
    
    After every phone call follow up with an email.
    
      To recap the conversation, so nothing goes un-noticed.
      If there needs to be a follow up, this is a good reminder to yourself as well as the client.
