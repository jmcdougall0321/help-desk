      Step 5: Drill Down Criteria
        
          This section will change from a Read only format to an editable format only if the Indicator being created is for Incident Counts, Incident Cost, or Corrective Actions (selected in the Tab field of the Data to represent section).

                  User can determine the number of columns as well as the column labels that appear in the drilldown.
                    
                      Important Note: Users can define up to 10 columns maximum due to size of data that will be included within each Indicator drilldown.

                      Choose the [SELECT ONE] tab option for the column you would like to remove. Upon save and close, this column will no longer be visible to the End User when the Drilldown has been selected from the Indicator
