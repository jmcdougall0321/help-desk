      First step will be to locate your SCORM zip file within the computer drive. Important Note: If you do not have the SCORM content zip file loaded to the computer in use’s drive (and all you have is a URL from your content provider) continue with steps a-b; otherwise skip to step 2.
         
        
          Take the download URL hyperlink and paste the text within a Google Chrome browser and click enter. You will see the content begin to download at the bottom left hand side of the browser and once the download is complete you can select the down arrow and click “Show in Folder”:
            
             
          
          Once you locate the downloaded file, you will need to right click to rename the file to be the desired course name (ex: Safety Orientation):
             
             
          
        
      
      Expand the TRAINING module and select the UPLOAD SCORM PACKAGE module item. (Note: This module item is controlled at the Profile Level; if you do not see it available reach out to your system administrator who can enable this per profile.)
      Click the Add button to upload 1 SCORM package at a time
    
     
  
  
    
      Click the Browse button from within the SCORM Package Input Form
      Browse for the downloaded SCORM zip file within the computer drive and click the Upload
        button
         
         
      
      The SCORM Package Input Form will refresh with the ‘Last Updated” date/time as well as the “Status” field will display “RUNNING” downloading is in progress.
      Once the download is complete the form will update to display the following Status: “FINISHED - Import Successful”, along with a blue hyperlink “Click here to Create Online Course based on the uploaded package”:
        
         
      
      By selecting the hyperlink, the window will refresh to now display the associated Course Input Form where the user can now define the course details (ex: Course Category, Course Name, Retraining, Requirements etc.). Important Note: The new course will default to INACTIVE so if you wish to make this immediately available you must check the Active checkbox.
      This new course will now show up at the very top of the COURSES module item within the TRAINING module; and the final step will be to assign to either ALL LOCATIONS or to individual locations by selecting the “Assign Location” button from the Courses search grid.
        
         
      
      SCORM package should now be available within the Cloud and will display/launch from the LMS as assigned per EMPLOYEE REQUIREMENTS & ASSIGNED LOCATIONS.
