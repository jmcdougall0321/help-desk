    I was looking through this bug [Task 29134: BUG - ASRC: Case Status] and it looks like ASRC is missing the FIELDS section within Profile Security.
     
    The fields section ‘Case Status’ is what will control the field within the form. The FORM ACTIONS do not control these – these are tied to the OLD General Details form.
     
    DEV – What needs to be done for this database to be updated?
     
     
    
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
    The only thing that needs to happen is remove the Module Item/Save and Close, re-add it and save and close. I have done this for ADMIN AIC Profile:
