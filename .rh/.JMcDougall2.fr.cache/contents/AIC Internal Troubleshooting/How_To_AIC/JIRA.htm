    Tracking Estimates
    JIRA estimates will be used by all support and implementation members as a tool to track the time associated to each task or project. These estimates will be used to determine the work load of each task or project and will provide transparency into the full active workload of each team member. Each individual is responsible for providing and maintaining the estimates and work logged associated to their work. Accurate estimate data is dependent on work logged within the ticket as work is completed.
    Basic Overview:
    -Initial estimate upon opening ticket
    
      All estimates should be in hours unless under 1 hour
        -Estimates can be adjusted as needed
      
      Time logged deducts from the estimate automatically
    
    -Reports will be pulled based on these estimates
    How to Create an Estimate
    
      When a ticket gets assigned to you: assess the ticket and what time estimate you think will be involved in order to fully complete and close out the ticket.
        
          For example: an average response to a generic question may take 1 hour.
        
      
      Navigate into the JIRA ticket and select the dropdown for More then click Log Work.
    
    
     
    Under the Remaining Estimate, click set to
    Enter the estimated time it will take you to complete the task (eg. 12h)
    If under 1h simply type the numeric amount (eg. 30) the default time is minutes.
    If no letter is associated next to your time (eg. 1h 15 = 1 hour 15 minutes), the system will default all time without a letter denomination minutes.
    Then enter the time spent in order to meet the required form fields.
    This should reflect the time spent evaluating the ticket for estimate (eg. 3m)
    
    
      Click Log at the bottom of the log work form to save your input.
      You will now see a new section at the bottom of your ticket for Time Tracking.
    
    Adjusting Estimates
    Adjusting estimates can be done at any time after beginning a task/project.
    
      If more or less work is identified, please repeat steps 2-6 above.
      Adjusting estimates is required for ongoing projects if the requirements change or if you identify additional/reduced work needed.
    
    oThis should be for 1 hour increments, any smaller amounts do not need to be updated in the estimate.
    **If a task/project is completed under the estimated time, please close the ticket and move on to the next ticket in your queue.
    FAQ
    
      What should I do if my ticket is a one-response ticket and my estimate was too high?

      What if I am not sure what the estimate should be?
        
          Consult another team member or the person who assigned the ticket to you.
