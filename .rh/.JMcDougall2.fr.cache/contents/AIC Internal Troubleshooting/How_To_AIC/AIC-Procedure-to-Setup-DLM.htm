    1.-Login to the Application using the desired customer’s database
     
    2.-Make sure the following module & module items are turned on:
    
      AIC Tools Module
        
          Data Loader Management Module Item
          Acknowledgements Module Item
          Expected Values Module Item
          Files Processed Module Item
        
      
    
     
    3.-You will need to add all expected values from the customer’s file. Go to the Expected Values module item and select the Add button.
     
    
    
      Value Type: This is the column header, such as CATEGORY, COUNTRY, etc. Select the type.
      Incoming Value from File: This is an Expected Value from the customer file. Type in the value here. You will need to create a record for each expected value in the file.
      Route to (Table Value): Select the corresponding value from the application. For example, an Incoming Value from File might be “Regular Parttime”. This would route to “PART-TIME”. Value types will vary from customer to customer so their distinctive types will be mapped to our own, respectively for:
    
     
    CATEGORY
    COUNTRY
    EMPLOYEE_STATUS
    GENDER
    MARITAL_STATUS
     
    To find the expected values in an Excel file, copy the column to another sheet. Then highlight the entire column and use the Remove Duplicates function in the Data tab to find each type being sent.
