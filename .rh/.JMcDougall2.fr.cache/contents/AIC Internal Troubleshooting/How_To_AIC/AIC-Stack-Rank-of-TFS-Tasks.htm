  Stack Rank of TFS Tasks  
  
    
      The Developers are currently working off of the Backlog list by Stack Rank of tasks
      Every task that is created within TFS will need to have a stack rank for the Developers to know what to work on next.
      Stack Rank will be a numerical number with 1 being the highest
    
    Example (1-5):
    
      Client Reported Bug, Implementations Task, Task Client is paying for
      Updating Incident Levels/Incident Level Descriptions
      Client wants to add a new Country to Production (can only add behind the scenes by Dev.)
      Bug in QA and Production – Not reported by Client with a workaround
      Bug in QA – Not on Production, Bug within an International Language
    
     
    
      Within TFS you will go to the WORK button at the top
      Then you will select work items
      Under the Team Favorites Tab you will select on This Weeks Backlog – all items that have been assigned to a Backlog iteration path will be within this list below
    
    
    
      If you do not provide a stack rank to your TFS Task, it will automatically drop down to the bottom of the list where the developers will not see it
