    During today’s touch base meeting you were asking about how Employee Hours could be represented in dashboard indicators. You wanted to display work hours by Month as a column. Currently you can only display by Hour Type with this indicator type. A workaround would be to use the Counter indicator type and create/copy one for each date range. I created the first indicator for the date range January then copied it down updating the date ranges for each month thereafter.
     
     
    
     
    In Report Center, there are several reports that will show you the number of hours worked by location.
