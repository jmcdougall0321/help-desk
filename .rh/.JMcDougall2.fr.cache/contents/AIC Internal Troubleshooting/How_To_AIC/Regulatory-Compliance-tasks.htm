    If these are recurring requirements, I would recommend updating the original requirement recurrence pattern to have it end by today’s date. This will then remove the future occurrences for the locations that no longer need them.
    
     
     
    How would I do that for just one location that is going to be inactive?
    Could you provide me the requirement and location that you are looking to end the recurrence pattern for? It may be best for you to mark the location as closed and leave the active box checked so that you can still report off of the historical data tied to the location.
     
    It would be for TWB Silao.  The tricky part is we do not want to close the facility until after our quarterly reporting so it can be included.  Is there a way to keep it active, yet remove the recurrence regulatory requirements for just this location.  I could close them, however then it appears they completed the task.
    
    Yes, you can unassign this Location from these requirements which will then mark it as complete and remove the future recurrence. The only issue I had was for the Hazardous Materials Inventory Review and Hazardous Materials Annual Record requirements. Neither of these were assigned to locations in the system. I first assigned them to the TWB Silao location, saved closed and refreshed. And then unassigned the TWB Silao location which completed and removed the future recurrences.
