  Injury and Illness Module
  Injury and Illness Module Overviewand Illness Module Overview
  
  The Injury/Illness Module is one of the most commonly used Modules. It serves as the basis of our Incident Management suite. Within this Module you are able to report on the incident records you have created, populate OSHA Logs, and submit claims to your TPA’s.
   
  In this Module you will enter of the information that you have gathered regarding an injury/illness incident. As you will see all of the modules and module items have a common user interface. When adding or editing a record there will be a series of tabs across the top of the incident form that will contain required data fields to save or maintain the record and a series of tabs across the bottom of the incident form for collecting additional information or attachments.
   
  Injury and Illness Module Item:
  Within the Injury/Illness Module Item you will see a dynamic search and display grid showing all previously entered incidents in the Injury and Illness module. What is unique about our search grid is by selecting the heading at the top of each column you can sort the records alphabetically or by date in the column selected. You can also search for a specific record using multiple columns to narrow down your search. Our system also supports wild card searches by putting a % symbol in front of and behind the partial word you have entered (ex: %Diego%).
  
   
  
  Adding an Incident Record:
  When adding a new record follow the steps below:
  
    Select the Add button, the Incident Type and Location Form will populate
    All required fields (marked with a red asterisk) must be complete before you can move onto the next step.
    Select the Type of report which is automatically populated in the dropdown.
    Next you can narrow down your location search by opening up your organizational structure. Once you find the group or level you are looking for click on it. All the locations available will automatically populate in the Select Incident Location drop down. Select the location for this record.
    The Final step is to select an employee for whom the record is being created for. The employees that automatically populate here are those who are assigned this location as their work location in the People Module item within the Administration Module. You will search for the employee by last name or employee number. In the search criteria field insert a letter or part of a name, all the employees that match the search criteria for that location will automatically populate in the employee dropdown.
  
  
    
    If you cannot find the employee you are looking for you are able to create a people record on the fly by clicking the Add New Employee Button. The employee details input form will populate for you to fill in the required information. Click save and close to return to the Incident Type and Location Form.
      
        Once the employee is selected or created click ok to move onto the Incident Form.
