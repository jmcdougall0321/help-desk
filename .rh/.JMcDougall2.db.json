reach out asking to hide/show/etc. certain fields in the application. Let’s take a look at how you can determine if/where you can do this (hint- for the most part, the answer is yes!)…\n    \n     \n     \n    Step 1 – What is the client asking for?\n    \n      To turn on something that they don’t see\n        \n          Example “do you have a section for tracking drug testing that we can use?”\n        \n      \n      To hide a field\n        \n          Example “can we hide the severity consequence matrix?”\n        \n      \n      To make a field required\n        \n          Example “we want to require incident level” Let’s take a look!\n             \n            Step 2 – Where can we do these things?\n          \n        \n      \n      There are 3 main areas we can check for these type of requests:\n        \n          Form actions in the profile security\n            \n              This will accommodate a variety of things, most things are available here so I recommend you check here first (things like requiring fields, hiding fields, turning on sections of the form, etc.)\n            \n          \n          Customize module\n            \n              Customize not only enables you to add new fields on forms but it also can hide/read-only/require fields. This depends on if the form is available to customize. Currently the forms that have this availability are as follows below. Please note, any form that does NOT have customize does not have any of this functionality, this is ONLY for these forms:\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n     \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  General Details within all incident modules\n                  Corrective action input form across all modules\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          Variables\n            \n              While this is the ‘oldest’ option, there are still a lot of valuable system customization options in here. The variables are located under aic tools > variables. This grid is somewhat complex to search so I recommend searching only a small part of what you are looking for in the variable name column. Sometimes you have to do a few searches to see if anything is available using different keywords.\n                \n                  For example, if you were looking for ‘drug and alcohol test’, try to search ‘drug’ then try ‘test’. Eventually you will determine if it is available or not by searching here.\n                  This is typically the last resort, use the profile first\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          Turn on/Turn off module item\n            \n              If you cant locate something in the profile, it may simply not be turned on in the system. AIC controls what is on and what is off through the aic tools module > turn on turn off module item (known as TOTO).\n              Within TOTO, you can update each module, and search for form actions that are not turned on.\n                \n                  Checked = turned on, available in the profile\n                  Unchecked = turned off, not available in the profile\n                \n              \n              You might be wondering, why don’t we just turn everything in TOTO on?\n                \n                  It is based on what the client licenses.\n                  Many of the available things DO NOT WORK. Take caution with the grid buttons and reports as some of these are turned off for a reason. If in doubt, just check with someone!\n                    Step 3 – It’s not available currently:\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      Let the client know it is not available.\n      If they push back asking us to add it after you let them know it isn’t available, add it to the potential future enhancements list (check first to see if anyone else has added it to avoid duplicates).\n    \n    \n    Step 2. Cont.\n    \n    Step 2. Cont\n    \n     \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/Adding-a-TFS-Task.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC

Pleasant location that is active. The incident 2019-096 was entered as a near miss and triggered the new incident alert that is set up to be sent to you since you created the alert. If you do not need or want to be notified for Near Misses we simply need to filter out Near Miss Module in the alert. If you don’t want to receive the alert altogether we can create a “Fake User” to be the creator of the alert which will remove you from the distribution list. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n    \n     \n    Well…I created so I could delete his old one that was sending to everyone. Fixing the mess so to speak. So can we just remove me altogether for this one and the Sun Prairie one? In the future each site would create their own. Would this be the same for any other I create for the organization? I am not sure I want to get them all and that part was not clear to me that even if I don’t include me in the distro list I get it because I created it. What about if they copy one? Does it include the original creator or create is as a “new one” and only send to the new creator? May be can have a call later today when I am out of this meeting after 5 (I am in Chicago) my time.\n     \n     \n    Anytime an alert is created the logged in user will automatically inherit that alert and will become a participant. If you do not wish to receive notifications for all the alerts you’ve created, best practice is to create a default “dummy” account. This would then allow you to login through the dummy account and create alerts without having to receive notifications for every single one. AIC can also update the created user of your current active alerts to the dummy account once it has been created. You will remain an owner of these alerts so that you can edit them as needed through your normal administrator account.\n     \n    An example of a dummy account is shown in the screenshot below. You would want to make sure that this account has access to all locations so that you can assign alerts out to your divisions accordingly. This can be accomplished by applying an Administrator profile to this user record. You would also want to insert a fake email address.\n    \n    Once the account is setup, I can create a development task to have the alerts that you created reassigned.\n     \n    When an alert is COPIED the person who copies the alert becomes the creator and the creator of the original alert would not inherit the notifications.\n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/AIC-How-to-Answer-the-Phone.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/AIC-How-to-Answer-the-Phone.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/AIC -

Our current future enhancement policy is flaky, unprofessional, and it’s a burden on you all to have you constantly bombarded with unhappy clients who are confused. If it is decided that an enhancement request is something is not happening now, we need to be more transparent. This was we set reasonable expectations with people.\n     \n    Of course, sometimes clients request things and we do them immediately and go around this process. Exceptions to rules cannot be avoided with technology – it is always changing. Please copy me on all of these emails, I want to be able to jump in if you get push back from a client so that you can retain a nice rapport with the people you are working with. Lauren will be polishing this up for a formal policy. Please move forward with this immediately, just copy and paste.\n     \n     \n    When a client submits an enhancement request, after you have created a ticket (or a ticket has been automatically created via aicsupport):\n     \n    “Hi Client, thank you for your enhancement request. Enhancement requests are reviewed on a bi-weekly basis, every other Thursday, so I will get back to you no later than the following Friday on the status of this item.”\n     \n     \n    After the request is reviewed, one of two options:\n     \n    We ARE doing it:\n     \n    “Hi Client, Thank you for your enhancement request. This item was accepted for development, and will be discussed at our development next week, for scheduling. This item may need additional documentation and discovery, so we may be reaching out to schedule a meeting next week to find out more. If there is a discovery process that requires documentation, a sign off from you will be required. Once the discovery is completed, this task is assigned to a developer. We will communicate updates on this process as they happen. Once the item is completed, it goes through rigorous QA testing to make sure that the system and functionally are working as designed. This is a part of our SOC 1 policy for proficiency and success and we thank you for being partners in this process.”\n     \n    We are not doing it:\n     \n    “Thank you for your feedback regarding this enhancement request. Your requests have been documented. When we are updating this module, we will reach out for feedback, however this is not on our 2019 roadmap. We are happy to share how this process works. Please let Elle McDougall, copied here know if you would like to set up a call so we can explain a little more about our enhancement and discovery process. ”.\n     \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/AIC-How-to-Build-an-Online-Course.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/AIC-How-to-Build-an-Online-Course.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/AIC -

Recordkeeping \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎This program discusses the provisions of OSHA's Recordkeeping Rule and incorporates the following changes effective January 1, 2004: \n    \n      Section 1904.12, Recording criteria for cases involving work-related musculoskeletal disorders, is deleted.\n      The requirement in section 1904.29(b)(7)(vi) stating that MSD injuries and illnesses are not to be considered privacy concern cases is deleted.\n      A column for recording hearing loss cases has been added to the OSHA Form 300 log.\n      An entry for hearing loss cases has been added to the OSHA Form 300A Summary.[Employers should use the old 300A Summary Form (without the hearing loss entry) to post as required in February 2004. The new 300A form that includes the hearing loss entry should be used to post in February 2005.]\n    \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Presenter's Note: Prior to the presentation, it is suggested that presenters review the latest information on the recordkeeping rule. In addition, presenters should print copies of OSHA's main Recordkeeping page as a handout to inform audience members of the latest information available on the website.\n      ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      OSHA has a new, improved set of rules for recordkeeping. These new requirements - Part 1904 of 29CFR - took effect January 1, 2002.\n      Injury and illness records are critical indicators - both for employers and for OSHA. They tell us how we're doing in our efforts to keep workers safe. They pinpoint weaknesses - breakdowns in machinery, inadequate personal protective equipment, failures in communication, insufficient training. When a worker gets sick or hurt, something has gone wrong. And employers need to look at these cases to see if they can take action to prevent future problems.\n      But there is also great value in reviewing the records as a whole to identify patterns and trends. What's happening in specific departments and across the facility? How does your injury and illness experience stack up against others in your industry? Is it clear that your employees understand the need to wear protective equipment and follow safety rules? Asking these questions - and taking action in response to the answers - can prevent future injuries and illnesses and improve a company's bottom line. Whenever OSHA visits a workplace, injury and illness records are the first thing the inspectors want to see. These records give us a starting point to identify where problems may lie. Of course, if a company has been tracking its experience and addressing these issues, what we may find is that the site has corrected hazards and resolved concerns.\n      In addition, each year about 80,000 sites in high-hazard industries are asked to send injury and illness data directly to OSHA. This gives us an opportunity to track data directly and identify individual sites that need to improve.\n      Records are important beyond individual establishments. We need to know how we're doing collectively - the entire U.S. workforce. We need to find out where the problems are so we can work to address them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys about 200,000 employers - of all sizes and in all industries - to develop the national estimate of workplace injuries and illnesses issued every December.\n    \n     \n    \n      ‎ \n    Slide 2 - Recordkeeping History\n      ‎\n      ‎\n      ‎Script: \n    \n      OSHA has required employers to keep injury and illness records since 1971, the year the agency was formed. This is the first major effort to improve the system established 30 years ago. Under the new rule, about 1.4 million sites will maintain injury and illness records.\n      The final rule was published on January 19, 2001.\n      The recordkeeping rule went into effect as scheduled on January 1, 2002, with two exceptions: requirements for recording hearing loss and defining musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).\n      On July 1, 2002, OSHA issued a final rule that revised the criteria for recording work-related hearing loss. Beginning January 1, 2003, you record a case when a hearing test reveals that an employee has experienced a work-related Standard Threshold Shift (STS) in one or both ears and the employee's total hearing level is 25 dB or more above audiometric zero in the same ear as the STS. Forms revised for use January 1, 2004 include a hearing loss column.\n      Also on July 1, 2002, the Agency asked for public comment on a delay for the definition of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and whether to include a separate column for MSDs on the OSHA 300 Log. Based on comments received, OSHA has decided not to include the separate MSD column and ¶ 1904.12 has been deleted. The deletion has no effect on an employer's obligation to record all cases meeting the requirements of ¶ 1904.4-1904.7. If a musculoskeletal disorder is work-related, and is a new case, and meets one or more of the general recording criteria, it must be recorded.\n      As noted earlier in this presentation, employers must begin to use the new OSHA Form 300 on January 1, 2004. The new 300A form that includes the hearing loss column should be used to post in February, 2005.\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 3 - Recordkeeping Goals\n      ‎\n      ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      In revising the rule, OSHA had several goals: improve the data, make recordkeeping simpler for employers, maximize the use of computers and technology, improve employee involvement and protect the privacy of the injured or ill worker.\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 4 - Am I Covered?\n      ‎\n      ‎\n      ‎Presenter's Note: Provide handout on Partially Exempt Industries.\n        ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      When it comes to OSHA recordkeeping, the first question an employer needs to ask is: Am I covered? Every employer - regardless of size or industry - must orally report any incident that involves the death of a worker and/or the hospitalization of three or more workers. You must call your local OSHA office or 1-800-321-OSHA within eight hours. You don't have to report most highway or commercial carrier accidents, but you must report fatal heart attacks that occur at work. [§1904.39]\n      If you have 10 or fewer workers, you normally do not need to keep injury and illness records. Remember to include temporary employees under your direct supervision in that count. And if you're in one of the exempt low-hazard industries, you don't have to keep records unless OSHA or BLS asks you to participate in their annual surveys. [§1904.1 & §1904.2]\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 5 - What is Recordable?\n      ‎\n      ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      Second, you need to know what to count. The injuries and illnesses you record must be new cases that are work-related. That includes pre-existing conditions that are significantly aggravated by workplace events or exposures. [§1904.4 & §1904.5]\n      What do you actually record? Injuries and illnesses that result in:\n        \n          Death\n          Days away from work\n          Restricted work or transfer to another\n          Medical treatment beyond first aid\n          Loss of consciousness\n          Significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed healthcare professional. [§1904.7]\n        \n      \n      We've also got a new list of exceptions - problems not considered work-related. The rule makes it clear that employers don't have to record cases involving eating and drinking food and beverages, common colds and flu, blood donations, and exercise programs. In addition, mental illness will not be recorded unless the employee voluntarily provides the employer with an opinion from an appropriate licensed healthcare professional stating that the employee's mental illness is work-related. But some injuries to employees doing work at home or while traveling on business are counted. [§1904.5]\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 6 - Other New Elements\n      ‎\n        ‎\n        ‎Script:\n     \n    \n      What you don't record are injuries or illnesses treated through first aid - such as taking aspirin, getting a tetanus shot, applying a butterfly bandage, draining a blister, wearing a finger guard, etc. For recordkeeping purposes, first aid cases are not recordable. The rule provides an absolute list of what is first aid. If a treatment is NOT on the list, it MUST be considered medical treatment. [§1904.7(b)(5)(ii)]\n      We're also making it simple when it comes to counting days away from work or days of restricted work activity - just count calendar days. This will make the counts more consistent and make the actual length of an injury or illness clear. [§1904.7(b)(3)]\n      Employers need to record all injuries from needles and sharps that are contaminated by another person's blood or other potentially infectious material, not just those that lead to illness. They'll also record a case for any worker removed from work under the provisions of an OSHA standard - such as lead. The new rule also makes it clear that work-related cases of tuberculosis should be recorded. [§1904.8; §1904.9; §1904.11]\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 7 - Forms\n      ‎\n      ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      Let's talk about the new forms. There are three: the 300 log, which replaces form 200; 301, which replaces 101; and 300A, a separate form to use to display the annual summary. [§1904.29]\n      The 300 log is a listing of all the injuries and illnesses at your site. You can maintain it on a computer or at another location as long as you can produce a copy at the workplace whenever it's needed. You have seven calendar days to fill in the form once you learn of a case.\n      The 301 form is the individual record of a work-related injury or illness. You'll fill out a new form for each case - again within seven calendar days. You can use an equivalent form if you prefer.\n      Form 300A is the summary of work-related injuries and illnesses. This is the one you post every year. The new rule requires a three-month posting - February 1 to April 30. The summary must be certified by a company executive - the owner, an officer of the corporation, the highest ranking company official working at that site, or his or her supervisor. Top management needs to be aware of the injury and illness experience of the site and verify that the records are accurate. [§1904.32]\n      With the new forms come new privacy protections for workers. You won't enter the name of workers for sensitive cases such as injuries or illnesses involving an intimate body part or the reproductive system, sexual assault, HIV or hepatitis infection, tuberculosis, mental illness or other similar cases. You do need to keep a separate, confidential identity list for these cases. Regardless of the injury or illness, if you share your records with anyone not authorized by the rule to see them, you must remove employee names before doing so. [§1904.29]\n      OSHA recordkeeping forms must be kept for five years following the year they cover. During that time you need to update the OSHA 300 form to include newly discovered cases or to show changes in old cases. You do not have to update the 301 and 300A forms. Be sure to transfer the recordkeeping forms if you sell your business. [§1904.33 & §1904.34]\n      There are some additional considerations. Temporary workers and contract workers, for example. You must record their injuries and illnesses the same as any other worker on your payroll, if you are supervising their work. [§1904.31(b)(2)]\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 8 - Employee Involvement\n      ‎\n      ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      To be sure your records are complete, you must tell each employee how to report a work-related injury or illness. This means setting up a reporting system and informing each worker of the system. [§1904.35]\n      Workers and their representatives have a right to review the 300 log - no later than the end of the next business day - with all the names on it, (except, of course, the names for the privacy concern cases). Workers, former workers or personal representatives must be able to get copies of Form 301 covering their own injuries or illnesses by the end of the next business day. Authorized representatives can have access to just the \"information about the case\" section of any or all 301 forms within seven calendar days. You must provide records within four business hours to authorized government representatives such as OSHA inspectors or NIOSH investigators. [§1904.35 & §1904.40]\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 9 - State Programs\n      ‎\n      ‎\n        ‎Script: \n    \n      States that operate their own job safety and health programs have adopted comparable recordkeeping rules that were also effective January 1, 2002. It's important in compiling national statistics that all employers use the same criteria for injuries and illnesses. For other recordkeeping provisions, for example, industry exemptions, state requirements may be more stringent than federal requirements.\n    \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎\n      ‎Slide 10 - For More Information\n      ‎\n      ‎\n      ‎Presenter's Note: Provide handout on most recent OSHA Recordkeeping Page from the OSHA website. Script: \n    \n      This system is a big improvement over the old - for everyone. Better records will help us better track injuries and illnesses and identify hazards that need further attention. Both workers and employers will benefit.\n    \n     \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/How To document library.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/How To document library.css"},{"origLink":"assets/media/Document%20Library%20Demo.wmv","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/assets/media/Document Library Demo.wmv"},{"origLink":"assets/media/Document%20Library%20Demo.wmv","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/assets/media/Document Library Demo.wmv"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/How To document library_files/image1.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/How To document library_files/image1.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/How To document library_files/image2.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/How To document library_files/image2.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/How To document library_files/image3.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/How To document library_files/image3.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/How To document library_files/image4.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/How To document library_files/image4.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/How To document library_files/image5.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/How To document library_files/image5.png"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/How To document library_files/image6.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/How To document library_files/image6.png"}],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::Title":"How To document library","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/How_To_AIC/How-To-document-library.htm::InnerText":"\n  How To – Document Library\n  Module Item – Corp Document Library: Allows Users to view Documents in the Corporate Library who have access.

These estimates will be used to determine the work load of each task or project and will provide transparency into the full active workload of each team member. Each individual is responsible for providing and maintaining the estimates and work logged associated to their work. Accurate estimate data is dependent on work logged within the ticket as work is completed.\n    Basic Overview:\n    -Initial estimate upon opening ticket\n    \n      All estimates should be in hours unless under 1 hour\n        -Estimates can be adjusted as needed\n      \n      Time logged deducts from the estimate automatically\n    \n    -Reports will be pulled based on these estimates\n    How to Create an Estimate\n    \n      When a ticket gets assigned to you: assess the ticket and what time estimate you think will be involved in order to fully complete and close out the ticket.\n        \n          For example: an average response to a generic question may take 1 hour.\n        \n      \n      Navigate into the JIRA ticket and select the dropdown for More then click Log Work.\n    \n    \n     \n    Under the Remaining Estimate, click set to\n    Enter the estimated time it will take you to complete the task (eg. 12h)\n    If under 1h simply type the numeric amount (eg. 30) the default time is minutes.\n    If no letter is associated next to your time (eg. 1h 15 = 1 hour 15 minutes), the system will default all time without a letter denomination minutes.\n    Then enter the time spent in order to meet the required form fields.\n    This should reflect the time spent evaluating the ticket for estimate (eg. 3m)\n    \n    \n      Click Log at the bottom of the log work form to save your input.\n      You will now see a new section at the bottom of your ticket for Time Tracking.\n    \n    Adjusting Estimates\n    Adjusting estimates can be done at any time after beginning a task/project.\n    \n      If more or less work is identified, please repeat steps 2-6 above.\n      Adjusting estimates is required for ongoing projects if the requirements change or if you identify additional/reduced work needed.\n    \n    oThis should be for 1 hour increments, any smaller amounts do not need to be updated in the estimate.\n    **If a task/project is completed under the estimated time, please close the ticket and move on to the next ticket in your queue.\n    FAQ\n    \n      What should I do if my ticket is a one-response ticket and my estimate was too high?\n        \n          Simply close the ticket, no adjustment to the estimate is needed.\n             \n          \n        \n      \n      What if I am not sure what the estimate should be?\n        \n          Consult another team member or the person who assigned the ticket to you.\n             \n          \n        \n      \n      Should I adjust my estimate if the client responds to the thread with a separate question or unrelated item?\n        \n          No, please create a new ticket for separate inquiries or threads.

workspace filters in JIRA for remaining estimate, this will display estimate information next to the tickets in the queue.\n            \n              This is located under the columns dropdown.\n

steps in setting up a Leveled scoring type audit.\n     \n    Important Notes:\n     \n    \n      Each question added to the audit will be assigned a level. This is done in the weight field on the question input form. The weight is the assigned level for the question.\n         \n      \n      The audit score will be the highest level that is successfully completed.\n         \n      \n      For example, if an audit has 5 levels, the user misses one question on Level 2, but passes Levels 1, 3, 4 and 5 with correct answers, the final score is Level “1” because the user did not pass Level 2.\n    \n    Step 1:\n    \n      Go to the Evaluation Module, Setup module item.\n      Select the “Add” button on the Evaluation Setup screen.\n    \n     \n    \n     \n    Step 2:\n    \n      \n        \n          The Properties Input Form will open.\n          Enter the Evaluation Name.\n          Select “Leveled” from the Scoring Type dropdown.\n          Select the desired Number of Levels for your audit, anywhere from 2 to 10.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n    Step 3:\n    \n      Go to the Answer Format mini tab and click on “Format”. This will launch the Response Format form.\n      Enter your Answer values and\n        %. This is the answer set that your end user will see when answering the evaluation.\n        \n          In this example, the user will select either Yes or No for each audit question.\n          If Yes is selected, they will receive 100% credit for the question. If No is selected, they will receive 0% credit for the question.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n    Step 4:\n    \n      Check the “Required Comment” box if you want your user to be required to enter a comment for each question.\n      Click OK to save your response format.\n    \n     \n    \n     \n    Step 5\n    \n      The values entered on the response format form will now appear on the Answer Format mini tab.\n           \n      \n      \n        Step 6\n      \n      \n        Questions can be classified for reporting purposes.\n      \n      On the Question Classification mini tab, click “Add”.\n      The Class Input Form will open. Enter the “Classification” and “Description” then click “OK”\n      You have the ability to add multiple question classifications for your audit.\n      To save your audit setup, click “Save and Close”.\n        Step 7\n      \n      From the Evaluation Setup screen, select the newly added audit and then click on the “Setup Questions” button.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        Step 8\n      \n      The Evaluation Setup form will open. This is where you will set up the structure of your audit as well as the individual audit questions.\n      To add folders, or sections, to your audit, click on the “New Folder” button.\n      The Folder form will open, enter the name of your folder then click “OK”.\n        Step 9\n      \n      After you have added the desired folders, you will then begin adding your audit questions.\n      Select the folder where you want your question to appear and then click on the “New Question” button.\n        \n        Step 10\n      \n      When the question form opens, enter your question text.\n      Next you will want to select the “Weight” of the question. This is the LEVEL for the particular question.\n      The values that appear in the Weight dropdown will be the number of Levels you selected when initially setting up your audit.\n        Step 11\n        \n          The Class dropdown will display those Question Classifications that you entered when setting up your audit.\n          Select the desired Class, then click “Save and Close”.\n             \n            Note: The question classification is for reporting purposes only and does not impact the audit score in any way.\n            Step 12\n          \n          Continue building out the audit questions, assigning each question the desired weight (level).\n        \n      \n    \n    Step 13\n    \n      The user will complete the audit, selecting the appropriate answer from the Auditor Score dropdown.\n        Step 14\n        \n          To view the score for your leveled audit, go to the Report Center Module, Report Center module item.\n          Under the Evaluation category, select Work Plan Score Sheet.\n            Step 14\n          \n          The audit is scored based on the answers entered for each level of the audit.\n          For example, if the location answered “Yes” for all Level 1 questions, but answered “No” for at least one Level 2 question, the location’s score would be “Level 1”.\n          The score is the highest level that the location successfully completed.\n        \n      \n    \n     \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal

instructions for integrating an automated Employee Demographic Feed.  \n     \n    The following file formats are accepted by the AIC Employee Loader:\n    \n      CSV (Comma Separated Values. (Recommended). We also accept any other type of delimiter. Ex: pipe delimited)\n      Fixed Width\n    \n    I have attached the Employee Demographic File CSV Template for you to provide all of the Employee information. (This is the recommended format for file transfer) I have also attached documentation outlining the field descriptions and Required Fields for the Employee Demographic File.\n    I: Fields\n    See below for a list of required fields within the template:\n    \n      \n        \n          EMPLOYEE_LOCATION_CODE: Employee Location Code is Column A in the attached template. This is the Employee’s specific Work Location. This column must contain Location Codes that already exist in the system. These codes are the Employee Location Codes that are associated to a Location in the Employee Location Codes (Mapping) Module Item. If the LOCATION provided on the file is not associated to a Location in the system, the Employee will be stored at the TEMP Location.\n             \n          \n          EMPLOYEE_NUMBER: Column B in the attached template. This is used as the Unique Identifier for each Employee, and cannot contain any duplicate values.\n             \n          \n          CATEGORY: Category of Employment: Column G in the attached template. The default options for this column are:\n            \n              Full-Time\n              Part-Time\n              Seasonal\n              Temporary\n              Retired\n              Contractor (OSHA Exempt)\n              Non-Employee (OSHA exempt)\n              Note: You can either choose to use our default values, or AIC can associate your organization’s current categories of employment within the system.\n                 \n              \n            \n          \n           EMPLOYEE_STATUS: Column H in the attached template. The default values are:\n            \n              Active\n              Inactive\n              You can use our default values, or AIC can associate your organization’s current statuses within the system.\n                 \n              \n            \n          \n          HIRE_DATE: Column K in the attached template. (Please use the following format: MM/DD/YYYY)\n             \n          \n          TERMINATION_DATE: (If reporting Inactive Employees, this field is required. If not, this field can be left blank) Column L in the attached template. (Please use the following format: MM/DD/YYYY)\n             \n          \n          FIRST_NAME: Column M in the attached template.\n             \n          \n          LAST_NAME: Column O in the attached template.\n             \n          \n          SUPERVISOR_ID: Column AC in the attached template. Note: This field is only required if your organization is providing the Supervisor First Name and Last Name. If not, this field can be left blank.\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    II: Ongoing File Feeds\n    \n      Frequency: Our EDI can process Employee Demographic Files at any frequency of your choice. (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)\n      Manual Input of Employees: At any point in time, Employees can be manually added into the system by using the People Module Item in either Administration or Injury and Illness Module. Keep in mind that the Employee Number is the unique identifier for each Employee. If the Employee Number is manually inputted, and the Employee is added within the next Employee File, the system will link the Employee Record and override any data that was previously saved for that Employee. If the Employee Number is left blank, the system will create a duplicate record with the new Employee File Data.\n      Full File vs. Delta File: For automated ongoing file feeds, you can choose to send a full Employee File each time, this will update any changes made to Employee records (Ex: Changing from Active to Inactive). Or you can choose to only send a Delta File which only contains the updates and new Employees from the file.\n      File Transfer Protocol (FTP / SFTP): An FTP or SFTP Site will be used to securely transfer the files. The site and Log-In credentials for the FTP Site will be shared with both parties to integrate AIC with your HR System. Once a file is placed on the SFTP Site, the Electronic Data Interface will process the file into your database.

Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/Benefits-of-Custom-Profile-Levels.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    Benefits of Custom Profile Levels\n     \n     \n    Overview\n     \n    This document will explain the benefits and importance of setting up custom profile levels for the AIC system. Going forward these can be modified and new profiles added to meet the needs of the Organization.\n     \n    The 3 most Common Profile Types are:\n    \n      ADMINISTRATOR\n      RECORDKEEPER (aka End User)\n      READ ONLY ( aka View Only)\n    \n     \n    By separating out different levels, you are granting access or limiting access based on the selections in the Profile Setup Form. How the leveling system works is that the lower the level #, the higher access ability the user will have. For example, if there are 4 levels set up in the application, the level 4's will have the \"lowest\" level of access, and will not have the ability to change the security setup for any of the level 3's, 2's, and level 1's access. The level 3's will have access to update the security setup for any of the level 4's because they are at a \"lower\" level. The level 2's can update the security setup for any of the level 3's & 4's etc.\n     \n    ADMINISTRATOR – Level 1\n     \n    This level is used for the head company Administrators who will be the ultimate decision makers for all actions within the application. For example, these users will be Adding/Editing Locations, Modifying the Organization Structure, Adding/Editing Pick Lists, User Setup, and Security Profiles Setup for Users, as well as Alerts setup. Users at this level (Usually only a select few) will have access to everything in the application, as well as access to all locations.\n    Administrators have the ability to make updates to any profile with a level that is \"higher\". EX: Level 2's, Level 3's or higher.\n     \n    \n      ‎RECORDKEEPER – Level 2\n     \n    This level is used for the users who will be entering in data on a daily basis. For example, these users will be Adding/Editing Incident Records, Entering Employee Hours, Corrective Actions/Activity Calendar, and Basic Reporting including OSHA reports. Recordkeepers usually only have access to 1 Location (Work Location).\n    Users in Level 2 have the ability to make updates to any profile with a level that is \"higher\". EX: Level 3's or higher\n     \n     \n    READ ONLY – Level 3\n     \n    This level is used for the users who will only be able to View, Print, and/or Pull Reports from the application. These users will be unable to Add, Edit, or Delete any data within the system.\n    Users in Level 3 (If there are no other levels \"higher\") will not have the ability to make any updates to any profile, even their own.\n     \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../../assets/css/CIENT TEMPLATE for robohelp.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/CIENT TEMPLATE for robohelp.css"}],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Sheet1","tagName":"a","innerText":""}],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::Title":"CIENT TEMPLATE ","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase5/CIENT-TEMPLATE.htm::InnerText":"\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              CLIENT NAME\n            \n            \n              ADDRESS 1\n            \n            \n              ADDRESS 2\n            \n            \n              CITY\n            \n            \n              COUNTY\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              EXAMPLE CLIENT\n            \n            \n              123 STREET\n            \n            \n              SUITE 200\n            \n            \n              SAN DIEGO\n            \n            \n              SAN DIEGO\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              COUNTRY\n            \n            \n              STATE/PROV\n            \n            \n              POSTAL/ZIP CODE\n            \n            \n              CLIENT CONTACT FNAME\n            \n            \n              CLIENT CONTACT LNAME\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              USA\n            \n            \n              CA\n            \n            \n              92127\n            \n            \n              JOHN\n            \n            \n              SMITH\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              CLIENT PHONE\n            \n            \n              ASSIGN TO ALL LOCATIONS\n            \n            \n              LOCATION CODE(S)\n            \n            \n              ACTIVE\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              8586732174\n            \n            \n              N\n            \n            \n              187, 124, 135, 170\n            \n            \n              Y\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase1/AIC-Location-Org-Structure-Details-Template.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/AIC Internal Troubleshooting/Implementation_Item/Phase1/AIC-Location-Org-Structure-Details-Template.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../../assets/css/AIC -

Implementation Team at AIC is looking forward to working with you on a very fast, easy, and successful system implementation. Our goal is to get the system ready for roll out in a timely and organized manner.\n     \n    Your AIC Project Management Team (PLACE CAM AT THE TOP)\n    \n      Amy Perry – Project Manager\n      Ashley Fallin - Project Manager\n      Breanne Ederer – Project Manager\n      Hannah Bilawa - Project Manager\n      Jeannine Comeaux – Project Manager\n      Ruth Martinez - Project Manager\n    \n    \n      Victoria Partington - Project Manager\n      Zach Houston – Project Manager\n      Valerie Cleare – President and C.E.O\n    \n     \n    Please send all emails to aicsupport@appsint.com.\n     \n    \n      ‎The AIC Approach\n     \n    Our approach is to make your implementation as uneventful as possible.\n     \n    To do this, we rely on our track record of large scale successful implementations, detailed project documentation and good communication with the client and implementation team.\n     \n    As part of the implementation we will provide:\n    \n      Project Documentation for integration points; Employee File, Employee Hours File, etc.\n      Excel based templates for defining pick list values, with defaults.\n      Excel based templates for the upload of historical data.\n      Environment for reviewing loaded data.\n        \n          As your Organization Structure and Location Data are loaded…review it!\n          As your pick list values are pre-populated…review it!!\n          As your historical data is loaded…review it!!\n          As part of the training process, we will create a copy of this environment for training your users.\n        \n      \n      Web based portal, https://projects.appsint.com for tracking all implementation specific supporting documentation, tracking action items with estimated completion dates (all enforced by automated email alerts and messaging), and status updates on the implementation. All implementation team members, both AIC and client, have access to the site and are encouraged to contribute.\n      Weekly “Touch Base” Meetings for discussing action item status, addressing questions from the group and to identify any impediments to the implementation.\n        \n          “Touch Base” Meetings are held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. The group will agree upon a time and a meeting notice will be provided.\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    Many of the action items happen in parallel. AIC has developed several tools that allow for the quick upload of project management data. For this reason it is important that data be provided in the exact format requested for quicker turnaround times.\n     \n    Next Stop…the GET ROLLING Meeting!!!\n    \n      ‎Implementation Tools - AIC Project Site\n     \n    As part of the implementation process, we also provide a web based tool for tracking all projects - supporting documentation as well as action items. Both the (Client Name) Implementation Team and the AIC Support Team will use the projects site to share necessary documents. All (Client Name) Implementation Team members will have access to the projects site.\n     \n    https://projects.appsint.com/\n     \n    You will be provided with login credentials (user name and password) for the Projects Site.\n     \n    After logging in, you will be able to see the list of outstanding projects, action items and completion status. You will also be able to access the documentation needed for the project from the Files mini tab.\n    \n    Compatibility Settings\n     \n    For optimal compatibility with your Application and the Projects Site, you will need to ensure your Internet Browser Settings are configured correctly. Located on the Projects Site within the Corporate Document Library, you will find documents outlining the settings that need to be updated on your browser to experience the applications full functionality.\n     \n    https://projects.appsint.com/\n     \n     \n    PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION\n    \n      ‎ \n    GET ROLLING Meeting!!!\n     \n    The “GET ROLLING!!!” Meeting is the official start of the implementation process. Here is your “GET ROLLING!!” Meeting Agenda.\n     \n    Team Introductions\n    \n      [Client Name]\n      AIC\n    \n     \n    Licensed Solutions (Customize for Client)\n    \n      One Global Platform®\n      Incident Management\n      Training w/LMS\n      Evaluation\n    \n     \n    Integration Points\n    \n      Employee Hours –[Customize for Client]\n      Employees – [Customize for Client]\n      Historical Data – [Customize for Client]\n      Workers Compensation Claims – [Customize for Client]\n      Vehicle Claim Submission – [Customize for Client]\n      General Liability Claim Submission – [Customize for Client]\n      SSO – [Customize for Client]\n    \n     \n    Projects Site Review\n    For this process we use the projects.appsint.com site for task tracking and documentation storage.\n    \n      All [Client Name] implementation team members will have access to this site.\n      The Project Site will keep track of all Action Items in one centralized portal for AIC and [Client Name] to streamline the Implementation progress.\n    \n     \n     \n     \n    \n      ‎ \n    Touch Base Meetings\n     \n    As part of the Implementation Process, we will schedule reoccurring Touch Base Meetings on a weekly basis. These meetings typically last anywhere from 15-30 minutes, and are used to go over the status of the Implementation and answer any questions you have. Touch Base Meetings can be scheduled weekly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.\n     \n    Prior to the first Touch Base Meeting, we must have your Database created. The following items are needed in order for AIC to create your database:\n     \n    \n      Customized Site URL\n      Application Name\n      Company Logo\n      Languages chosen\n      Alert Details\n    \n     \n    AIC also requires that you provide your Organization Structure and Locations prior to the first Touch Base Meeting. Everything in the system is tied back to the Location, therefore it is important to have this in place when beginning the Implementation. You can upload this to the Files mini tab on the Project Site.\n     \n    We will work with your team to find a date and time each week that will work with your schedule. Everyone who is actively involved in the Implementation will be invited to join via WebEx Webinar.\n     \n    \n      ‎ \n    Organization Structure/Location Data\n     \n    The Organization Structure and Location List are key elements within the application, as all of the data ties back to the location. After the initial upload, we will cover how to maintain the Organization Structure through tools provided in the application in the Administrator Training.\n     \n    The documents for this can be found on our projects website at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library.\n     \n    The template contains two worksheets:\n    \n      Locations to Load – Please use the corresponding worksheet to provide a list of your work locations to be uploaded in the application.\n      Org Structure Example – The system will not only store your locations but allows you to map out your Organization Structure as well. This worksheet is an example of an Org Structure to aid in the documentation process.\n    \n     \n    Template Snapshot\n    \n    Organization/Location data must be delivered in the template provided.\n     \n    \n    Organization Structure Snapshot\n    \n      ‎ \n     \n    PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION\n    \n      ‎ \n    Employee File (Demographic) Feed\n     \n    The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System is an open platform and provides the ability to “load” employee demographic information from an HRIS or Employee Demographic System on an ongoing basis. With this in place, data entry is streamlined as there is no need to manually enter employees into the application.\n     \n    The document that explains the secure process for bringing over employee data on a periodic basis can be found at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library. This document includes details on:\n    \n      File Format (Fixed Width or CSV)\n      File Naming\n      Record Inclusion\n      File Encryption (Required)\n      Transmission Frequency\n      FTP/SFTP Information\n      Online Training – E Learner Usernames Generation\n         \n        Note: Employees can be manually added to the application through the interface provided.\n         \n        Data Integrity\n         \n        To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements.\n         \n        People Role Assignments\n         \n        Role assignments are available for employees as part of the upload process. These can be assigned individually or by groups/profile levels. Each user can have as many or as few roles as needed.\n         \n        Assignments can be made at the time of adding employees or after exploration of the application.\n         \n        By selecting a specific role that employee will automatically populate into any drop downs or pick lists that requires a responsible person for that location.\n        \n          ‎Employee Hours Feed\n         \n        The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System is an open platform and provides the ability to “load” employee hours worked demographic information from an HRIS or Payroll System on an ongoing basis. With this in place, data entry is streamlined as there is no need to manually enter this data into the application. This is information is used for Federal Compliance Reports, Frequency/Severity Rate Calculations and data normalization.\n         \n        The document that explains the secure process for bringing over employee hours worked data on a periodic basis can be found at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library. This document includes details on:\n      \n      File Format (Fixed Width or CSV)\n      File Naming\n      Record Inclusion\n      File Encryption (Required)\n      Transmission Frequency\n      FTP/SFTP Information\n    \n     \n    There are four options for the upload of Employee Hours worked data based on the needs of the Organization:\n    \n      Employee Hours Worked by Location by Month (most commonly used)\n      Employee Hours Worked by Location – Department by Month\n      Employee Hours Worked by Location by Day\n        \n          Recommended if looking to report by Fiscal Year.\n        \n      \n      Employee Hours Worked by Employee\n    \n     \n    Note: Employee Hours can be manually added to the application if needed.\n     \n    Data Integrity\n     \n    To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements.\n     \n     \n    \n      ‎ \n    Automated Feeds\n    Acknowledgements - Exceptions\n     \n    As part of the automated employee and employee hours file transmission process we send automated e-mails to inform team members of the upload status.\n     \n    We break exception into three types which are communicated via email to your designated team members.\n     \n    Emails consist of a summary PDF and detail excel file:\n    \n      Type 1 – No File Received as Scheduled\n      Type 2 – File Received but were unable to process. In this case, a detailed reason is provided.\n      Type 3 – File was processed successfully. Email provides:\n        \n          Number of records in File\n          Number of records Added\n          Number of records Updated\n          Number of records that were not processed\n          Any exceptions\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    Moving forward you will receive these emails directly from alerts@appsint.com.\n     \n    As part of the implementation process we will identify the recipients and the types of exceptions they should receive via email.\n    \n      ‎ \n    Incident Management Solution - Pick List Validation Tables\n     \n    Within the application we standardize and streamline data entry through pick lists (pre-defined values) instead of having the end user type in the values. This also ensures consistent data for accurate reporting. For many of the items you’ll find that there are default values for you to review, modify and send back for upload. The maintenance of these values going forward can be done within the application through the point and click user interface. There are several items that we strongly suggest be identified up front. The remaining items can be defined as users add records to the application.\n     \n    AIC provides default or example values for the majority of the picklists in the application.  A template for defining and uploading picklists can be found on the projects website at https://projects.appsint.com, Corporate Document Library.\n     \n    \n    \n      ‎ \n    Case Numbering\n     \n    Within the application, each Incident that is entered is assigned a case number to use as an identifier. Below are the available options for Case Numbering.\n     \n    User Generated: This will be a free form text box for the User to manually enter any case number of your choice.\n     \n    Auto Generated: A Case Number will be automatically assigned to each Incident by the system.\n    \n      If choosing to use the system-generated case numbering, these can be generated as a sequence per Location, or on a global scale.\n         \n        \n          By Location – Each Location will have their own sequence. Example:\n            \n              San Diego Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003\n              New York Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003\n              Available Formats: (YYYY=Year, L=Location Code, M=Month, ###=Consecutive numbering)\n                \n                  YYYY-L-###\n                  YYYY-L-####\n                  MLYY###\n                  YYYY-###\n                     \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          Global: The case numbers will be unique, regardless of which location the incident was created for.

Although not necessary for roll out, we have the ability to load your historical data to the application using a series of excel based templates. This provides the Organization an opportunity to review, consolidate and “scrub” their historical data if needed. Please identify the types, and sources, of your historical data and notify your AIC Implementation team. We will then provide you with the necessary templates and instructions for upload.\n     \n    AIC allows for a one-time upload of Historical Data per Module. We recommend gathering all data together prior to providing to AIC. Going forward, you can upload Historical Data manually into the application.\n     \n    Template Snapshot\n     \n    \n     \n     \n    Important Notes:\n    \n      Historical Data is not required for Go-Live, and shouldn’t hold up the rollout process.\n      Please allow 3 weeks turnaround time for Historical Data. (1 week to review, one week to upload to Training and verify, one week to upload to Production).\n    \n    \n      ‎ \n    TPA – Claim Submission\n     \n    The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System provides the ability to submit Claims electronically to a Third Party Administrator. We have the ability to integrate with any TPA for Workers Compensation Claims, Vehicle Liability Claims, and General Liability Claims. This replaces:\n    \n      Phoning\n      Faxing\n      Emailing\n    \n    …and promotes data consistency by eliminating duplicate data entry.\n     \n    **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER - AIC will NOT add client defined / custom fields to any existing Third Party Administrator (TPA) Claim Submission Electronic Data Integration (EDI). AIC has stringent security requirements as part of our System and Organization Controls (SOC) Report under the SSAE-18 standard audits, which limit AIC in sending anything outside the scope of the current integration. AIC will not do anything that may affect data integrity for our clients.\n    **IMPORTANT NOTE - AIC is the first notification to the TPA, not the State. AIC will send the TPA the basic required information in order to file the First Report of Injury (FROI) with the insurance company/TPA. These are regulatory reports and AIC does not want to require anything beyond the basic requirements; based on our experience requiring additional fields may lead users to enter false information in order to get the claim submitted. Many times additional fields (beyond the basic requirements) are not available when the initial claim is entered and submitted to the TPA.\n     \n    To submit Workers Compensation claims from the application, we will need to work with your TPA to setup the process.\n     \n    Please send an email to the TPA contact person we will need to work with, introducing AIC so they can be prepared and receptive for us to contact them.\n    \n    \n      ‎\n    ADDITIONAL SOLUTION(S) IMPLEMENTATION\n    \n      ‎ \n    Training (LMS) Setup - Learning Management System (LMS) Portal\n     \n    As part of the e-Learning process, e-Learners will access the LMS portal to manage their training responsibilities.

AIC VALIDATION TABLE OVERVIEW - LESSONS LEARNEDE U\n    \n    \n      ‎ \n    Leading Indicator Module\n     \n    The Leading Indicator Module will allow you to build a library of Leading Indicators that can be used to build scorecards.\n     \n    Once a scorecard has been established, it can be assigned to Locations by Organization Level, Location or Location Group and/or it can be assigned to individual users of the application.\n     \n    Responsible individuals at the location level will receive a monthly email that can be used to update their data directly from a hyperlink in the email without having to log into the application.\n     \n    Data will be entered monthly, however goals can be evaluated:\n    \n      Monthly\n      Quarterly\n      Yearly\n    \n     \n    In addition, reminder alerts can be setup and sent to vested parties for the locations they have access to when data is not entered by a certain day of the month.\n     \n    From a tracking standpoint, there are two options:\n    \n      Report Builder – Case List Report – Which will allow a user to build a report extracting the raw data entered into the application each month and schedule it for automated delivery.\n        \n          This report can be exported as a PDF, Excel, CSV or RTF.\n             \n          \n        \n      \n      Dashboard – Setup the leading indicator scorecards on the dashboard to track the number of locations that have met their goals for a given time frame.\n    \n    \n      ‎ \n    Regulatory Compliance Module\n     \n    The Regulatory Compliance Module allows you to define and manage all of your organization specific requirements for each location, for example permits, certifications, audits, leases, and more.  The Compliance Solution integrates into AIC's One Global Platform® which will enforce your business processes through automated email notifications and messages, reminders, escalations alerts, as well as provide real-time access to your data through robust reporting and dashboards with drill-down.\n     \n    Client Defined Requirements\n     \n    The new Compliance Module will be used for maintaining the location based compliance and reporting items with the following six objectives in mind:\n     \n    \n      Define – Corporation defines which Compliance and Reporting Requirements are relevant to their company.\n      Assign – Assign Compliance and Report Requirements based on Location.\n      Track - Upload supporting documentation and utilize the One Global Platform® for maintaining Corporate Compliance.\n      Remind - Client defined automated email alerts and messages based upon time, event, or threshold.\n      Report - Use the AIC Report Builder to build and schedule reports for automated delivery to show status of upcoming/past due requirements. \n      Dashboards – Through the use of the dashboard you will be able to see all requirements per location complete with drill down into the details of the requirement.\n    \n    \n      ‎ \n    Going Live\n    Exciting times!!!\n     \n    Your site has been created and…\n    \n      The Organization/Location Structure has been uploaded.\n      All excel templates provided during the process have been completed, provided to AIC and uploaded successfully to the application.\n      All integration points (data points) are complete operational.\n        \n          Employee File Successfully Uploaded\n          Employee Hours File Successfully Uploaded\n          Claim Submission Integration complete\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    Once all of these items are in place and the data has been uploaded successfully to the application….we will have you up and running within thirty days from that point.\n    Important Note: We do not schedule Go Live Dates on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or Mondays.\n     \n    Time estimates are contingent on receiving complete data.\n     \n     \n     \n    Ongoing Administrative Responsibility\n     \n    After the initial implementation of the system the time needed for ongoing maintenance of the application is minimal. Users who have administrator level access have the ability to maintain the following core data within the application.\n     \n    Organization Structure\n     \n    As your Org Structure changes, you can use the drag and drop functionality within the application to easily make updates or add additional levels.\n    \n      The Org Structure controls how the data rolls up for reporting purposes.\n      If you move a location within the Org Structure, the data automatically moves with it since data is tied to locations.\n    \n     \n    Locations\n     \n    Update the application to add any new locations, make them in-active, or closed.\n    \n      Usually a location will be a physical location.\n      Incidents and employees are tied to locations.\n      Administrators have the ability to control mapping codes to locations.\n    \n     \n    Users / User Profiles\n     \n    Setup usernames/passwords for users to login to the application.\n    \n      Select the locations the users will have access to.\n      User access to application functionality is determined by the user “Profile” they are assigned to.\n      User Profiles can be modified by administrators.\n    \n     \n    Tools\n     \n    Once you’ve gone live with the application there are a series of tools available for measuring system usage:\n    \n      Login History for tracking login attempts; successful and unsuccessful.\n      Last Login Date per User\n      Automated Email Alerts\n      Using the Automated Reports for verifying the type and quality if the data being entered.\n    \n    As part of the implementation process your Implementation Lead will walk through these tools and make some recommendations on how you may want to use them based on your business processes.\n     \n    Change Request Sign Off \n     \n    Although AIC is able to customize various areas of the system during the implementation process; for any change that will require AIC development work the AIC Discovery Process will be required. This is the full process we adhere to for all changes/enhancements. Depending on the size and scope of the change, this process may take anywhere from a few minutes for a simple label change to several months for a new module. The final product will be a document that will detail development work and associated time and cost. The investment in these services is typically $200.00 per hour (may change at AIC upper management discretion), billed as actual. If you want to proceed with development, we will credit the discovery process fee to your project.\n     \n    This sign off document indicates the [CLIENT] agrees that custom development will not be requested for a minimum of 90 days after the implementation process is complete and users have been actively entering records into the application.\n     \n     \n     \n    Signed this ______ day of

document outlines the steps in setting up a Leveled scoring type audit.\n     \n    Important Notes:\n     \n    \n      Each question added to the audit will be assigned a level. This is done in the weight field on the question input form. The weight is the assigned level for the question.\n         \n      \n      The audit score will be the highest level that is successfully completed.\n         \n      \n      For example, if an audit has 5 levels, the user misses one question on Level 2, but passes Levels 1, 3, 4 and 5 with correct answers, the final score is Level “1” because the user did not pass Level 2.\n    \n  \n  \n     \n    Step 1:\n    \n      Go to the Evaluation Module, Setup module item.\n      Select the “Add” button on the Evaluation Setup screen.\n    \n     \n  \n  \n    \n     \n    Step 2:\n    \n      \n        \n          The Properties Input Form will open.\n          Enter the Evaluation Name.\n          Select “Leveled” from the Scoring Type dropdown.\n          Select the desired Number of Levels for your audit, anywhere from 2 to 10.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Step 3:\n    \n      Go to the Answer Format mini tab and click on “Format”. This will launch the Response Format form.\n      Enter your Answer values and\n        %. This is the answer set that your end user will see when answering the evaluation.\n        \n          In this example, the user will select either Yes or No for each audit question.\n          If Yes is selected, they will receive 100% credit for the question. If No is selected, they will receive 0% credit for the question.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n    Step 4:\n    \n      Check the “Required Comment” box if you want your user to be required to enter a comment for each question.\n      Click OK to save your response format.\n    \n     \n  \n  \n    \n     \n    Step 5\n    \n      The values entered on the response format form will now appear on the Answer Format mini tab.\n        \n      \n      \n        Step 6\n        Questions can be classified for reporting purposes.\n      \n      On the Question Classification mini tab, click “Add”.\n      The Class Input Form will open. Enter the “Classification” and “Description” then click “OK”\n      You have the ability to add multiple question classifications for your audit.\n      To save your audit setup, click “Save and Close”.\n         \n        Step 7\n      \n      From the Evaluation Setup screen, select the newly added audit and then click on the “Setup Questions” button.\n        \n        \n        Step 8\n      \n      The Evaluation Setup form will open. This is where you will set up the structure of your audit as well as the individual audit questions.\n      To add folders, or sections, to your audit, click on the “New Folder” button.\n      The Folder form will open, enter the name of your folder then click “OK”.\n         \n        Step 9\n      \n      After you have added the desired folders, you will then begin adding your audit questions.\n      Select the folder where you want your question to appear and then click on the “New Question” button.\n        \n        Step 10\n      \n      \n        When the question form opens, enter your question text.\n      \n      \n        Next you will want to select the “Weight” of the question. This is the LEVEL for the particular question.\n      \n      The values that appear in the Weight dropdown will be the number of Levels you selected when initially setting up your audit.\n        Step 11\n        \n          The Class dropdown will display those Question Classifications that you entered when setting up your audit.\n          Select the desired Class, then click “Save and Close”.\n             \n            Note: The question classification is for reporting purposes only and does not impact the audit score in any way.\n            \n          \n          \n            Step 12\n          \n          Continue building out the audit questions, assigning each question the desired weight (level).\n        \n      \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n    Step 13\n    \n      The user will complete the audit, selecting the appropriate answer from the Auditor Score dropdown.\n        Step 14\n        \n          To view the score for your leveled audit, go to the Report Center Module, Report Center module item.\n          Under the Evaluation category, select Work Plan Score Sheet.\n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n            Step 14\n          \n          The audit is scored based on the answers entered for each level of the audit.\n          For example, if the location answered “Yes” for all Level 1 questions, but answered “No” for at least one Level 2 question, the location’s score would be “Level 1”.\n          The score is the highest level that the location successfully completed.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n","Path::contents/AIC Internal

   The Property Damage Module is part of our Incident Management suite. Within this Module you are able to report on the Property Damage records you have created and print a short report for any of the records within this Module.\n    In this Module you will enter all of the information that you have gathered regarding a Property Damage incident. As you will see all of the modules and module items have a common user interface. When adding or editing a record there will be a series of tabs across the top of the incident form that will contain required data fields to save or maintain the record and a series of tabs across the bottom of the incident form for collecting additional information or attachments.\n    Within the Property Damage Module Item you will see a dynamic search and display grid showing all previously entered incidents in the Property Damage Module. What is unique about our search grid is that by selecting the heading at the top of each column, you can sort the records alphabetically or by date in the column selected. You can also search for a specific record using multiple columns to narrow down your search. Our system also supports wild card searches by putting a % symbol in front of and behind the partial word you have entered (ex: %Diego%).\n  \n  \n     \n  \n  \n    \n    Adding a Property Damage Incident Record:\n    When adding a new record follow the steps below:\n    \n      Select the Add button, the Incident Location Form will populate\n      All required fields (marked with a red asterisk) must be complete before you can move onto the next step.\n      Next you can narrow down your location search by opening up your organizational structure.

To populate this drop down a major event incident must be added to the Major Event Incidents Module Item within the Administration Module. This dropdown is used for capturing general incident information and allocating it across multiple modules to associate common dates, times, location and general details of a major event. Example: There is a fire on the manufacturing floor, which causes a Property Damage, which results in a slip/ trip/ fall injury of and employee. These are 3 separate incidents, but 1 major event.\n      There is an additional pick list for Location Code.\n      Next we have the Incident Level pick list that is client defined, as are all pick list values throughout the application. The “what’s this” button can be selected to display your incident severity levels and their corresponding descriptions. To change the description of this pick list or the levels contact AIC Support.\n      Date of Incident, Incident Time, Date Reported to Employer, and Time Reported to Employer can be selected by clicking on the time or date field, you will see a calendar control or time drop down for accuracy purposes.

Hours Email for robohelp","Path::contents/Employee_Hours_Email_for_robohelp.htm::InnerText":"Employee Hours EmailBelow I have outlined your options and instructions for integrating an automated Employee Hours Feed.   There are four options for the upload of Employee Hours data based on the needs of your Organization:Employee Hours by Location / By Month (Recommended)Employee Hours by Location / By Department / By MonthEmployee Hours by Location / By Employee / By Month Employee Hours by Location / By Day  Keep in mind that Employee Hours will be tracked as one summed value per Location in the system. I have attached the template for Employee Hours by Location by Month for you to use as a reference, as this is the most commonly used format. If not using this format, please let me know which type of Employee Hours you will be sending so I can provide the appropriate template. Employee Hours by Location by Month: The template attached has 2 tabs found near the bottom of the spreadsheet: CSV TEMPLATE and FIELD DESCRIPTIONSThe CSV Template is where you will input the Employee Hours Data. This file must be saved as a CSV with no formatting or additional columns added.  The Field Descriptions explain each data field with a description as well as outlines the required fields.  I: Column Headers These need to remain in their exact format. If a column is not being used, leave it blank instead of removing the column. LOCATION_CODE: This column must contain Location Codes that already exist in the system. These codes are the Employee Location Codes that are associated to a Location in the Employee Location Codes (Mapping) Module Item. If the LOCATION_CODE provided on the file is not associated to a Location in the system, the Hours will be stored at the TEMP Location. (This is a required field).YYYY: This column contains the Year of the Employee Hours. It must be a 4-digit number. (This is a required field).MM: This column contains the Month of the Employee Hours. It must be a 2-digit number. Example: February=02, December=12. (This is a required field).Note: Leading zeros will need to be sent for 1-digit months. If a CSV File is opened in Excel, the leading zeros may be dropped. Note: The system will not accept Hours for future dates, therefore forecasting of hours will cause an exception in the file. HOURLY_HRS: This column is for the total number of Hours for Hourly Employees. TEMP_HRS: This column is for the total number of Hours for Temporary Employees.SALARY_HRS: This column is for the total number of Hours for Salary Employees. NUMBER_EMP: This column is the total Number of Employees at the specified Location.  II: Ongoing File Feeds Summed Hours: Employee Hours are processed as 1 summed value for each Location per Month. Therefore if you are sending multiple files in 1 month, keep in mind that the latest total of Hours will override any existing values for that month. Example: If a file is sent week 1 with 200 Hours, and an additional 200 Hours are worked the following week, the file will need to contain 400 Total Hours as this functions as a running month-to-date sum. Adjustments: Negative Numbers are not accepted by the Electronic Data Interface (EDI). If an adjustment of hours is needed, enter the new total of hours which will override the existing value in the system.Frequency: Our EDI can process Employee Hours Files at any frequency of your choice. (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.) Manual Input of Hours: At any point in time, Employee Hours can be manually added or adjusted for any Location. (Injury and Illness Module > Employee Hours Module Item)File Transfer Protocol (FTP / SFTP): An FTP or SFTP Site will be used to securely transfer the files. The site and Log-In credentials for the FTP Site will be shared with both parties to integrate AIC with your HR System. Once a file is placed on the FTP Site, the Electronic Data Interface will process the file into your database. At this time you will receive an Acknowledgement File outlining the results of the processed file, and any exceptions that may have occurred.  III: Data Integrity To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements listed above.","Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"assets/css/Creating New FTP RH.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/Creating New FTP RH.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Creating New FTP RH_files/image1.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Creating New FTP RH_files/image1.png"}],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::Title":"Creating New FTP RH","Path::contents/Creating_New_FTP_RH.htm::InnerText":"Creating New FTP/SFTP SiteSFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a secure tool which facilitates data access and data transfer over a Secure Shell (SSH) data stream. In order to get access to the SFTP Site you will need to use a FTP application (such as FileZilla a free FTP solution that can be downloaded from the internet). You may need to involve your IT team as there may be an internal application that could be used for this process; and if not then you may need permission to download an application from the internet. Important Note: AIC cannot recommend or suggest any application (such as FileZilla) since they are third party solutions that AIC does not have control over; however the screenshot of the FileZilla application shown below is what AIC uses for both FTP and SFTP file transfers with our clients today.  Once within the application you will be asked to provide the following four data fields (which I have highlighted in the screenshot below):Host: sftp.appsint.comUsername: Password: Please call the office 858.673.2174 to receive the password over the phone for security purposes.Port: 22After access has been granted you will be able to navigate through the directories (aka folders) as well as upload and retrieve files when necessary.

This is used as the Unique Identifier for each Employee, and cannot contain any duplicate values.  CATEGORY: Category of Employment: Column G in the attached template. The default options for this column are:Full-TimePart-TimeSeasonalTemporaryRetiredContractor (OSHA Exempt)Non-Employee (OSHA exempt)Note: You can either choose to use our default values, or AIC can associate your organization’s current categories of employment within the system.  EMPLOYEE_STATUS: Column H in the attached template. The default values are:Active Inactive You can use our default values, or AIC can associate your organization’s current statuses within the system.  HIRE_DATE: Column K in the attached template. (Please use the following format: MM/DD/YYYY) TERMINATION_DATE: (If reporting Inactive Employees, this field is required. If not, this field can be left blank) Column L in the attached template. (Please use the following format: MM/DD/YYYY) FIRST_NAME: Column M in the attached template. LAST_NAME: Column O in the attached template.  SUPERVISOR_ID: Column AC in the attached template. Note: This field is only required if your organization is providing the Supervisor First Name and Last Name. If not, this field can be left blank.  II: Ongoing File Feeds Frequency: Our EDI can process Employee Demographic Files at any frequency of your choice. (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.) Manual Input of Employees: At any point in time, Employees can be manually added into the system by using the People Module Item in either Administration or Injury and Illness Module. Keep in mind that the Employee Number is the unique identifier for each Employee. If the Employee Number is manually inputted, and the Employee is added within the next Employee File, the system will link the Employee Record and override any data that was previously saved for that Employee. If the Employee Number is left blank, the system will create a duplicate record with the new Employee File Data. Full File vs. Delta File: For automated ongoing file feeds, you can choose to send a full Employee File each time, this will update any changes made to Employee records (Ex: Changing from Active to Inactive). Or you can choose to only send a Delta File which only contains the updates and new Employees from the file. File Transfer Protocol (FTP / SFTP): An FTP or SFTP Site will be used to securely transfer the files. The site and Log-In credentials for the FTP Site will be shared with both parties to integrate AIC with your HR System. Once a file is placed on the FTP Site, the Electronic Data Interface will process the file into your database. At this time you will receive an Acknowledgement File outlining the results of the processed file, and any exceptions that may have occurred. Important Note: Since Employee Data contains sensitive information, please do not email / attach the completed Employee Demographic file, as this is not a secure way of transmitting the data. Using an FTP/SFTP Site will securely transfer the files. If an FTP Site has not been set up, you can choose to utilize the Files mini tab within the Project Site.  III: Data Integrity To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements listed above.

Be sure to populate the SYS_CREATED_USR with your phone extension preceded by a negative ( - ). Ex. Bob would put -420. Populate SYS_CREATED_DTM with GETDATE().Updates – Corresponding table columns and update values are listed on the same line. Be sure to populate the  SYS_UPDT_USR with your phone extension preceded by a negative ( - ). Ex. Bob would put -420. Populate SYS_UPDT_DTM with GETDATE().Looking up last updated user – Find the SYS_UPDT_USR and SYS_UPDT_DTM fields. The value in the SYS_UPDT_USR field corresponds to the person’s user account ID.How to tell if a record was deleted by a user – SYS_ACTIVE_F = N while ACTIVE_F = Y.Commonly used tables:Expected Values - ECM84_DATA_MAPPINGIncident records - IMM01 v.
