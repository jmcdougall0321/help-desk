Â </p><p> </p><p>There are four options for the upload of Employee Hours data based on the needs of your Organization:</p><ul data-start="1" class="List0" xmlns=""><li>Employee Hours by Location / By Month (Recommended)</li><li>Employee Hours by Location / By Department / By Month</li><li>Employee Hours by Location / By Employee / By Month </li><li>Employee Hours by Location / By Day </li></ul><p> </p><p>Keep in mind that Employee Hours will be tracked as one summed value per Location in the system. I have attached the template for Employee Hours by Location by Month for you to use as a reference, as this is the most commonly used format. If not using this format, please let me know which type of Employee Hours you will be sending so I can provide the appropriate template.</p><p> </p><p>Employee Hours by Location by Month:</p><p> </p><ul data-start="1" class="List2" xmlns=""><li>The template attached has 2 tabs found near the bottom of the spreadsheet: CSV TEMPLATE and FIELD DESCRIPTIONS<p><img src="assets/images/Employee Hours Email for robohelp_files/image1.png" alt="Picture 3"/></p></li><li>The CSV Template is where you will input the Employee Hours Data. This file must be saved as a CSV with no formatting or additional columns added. <p> </p></li><li>The Field Descriptions explain each data field with a description as well as outlines the required fields. <p> </p><p>I: Column Headers</p><p> </p><p>These need to remain in their exact format. If a column is not being used, leave it blank instead of removing the column. </p><p><img src="assets/images/Employee Hours Email for robohelp_files/image2.png" alt="Picture 2"/></p></li><li>LOCATION_CODE: This column must contain Location Codes that already exist in the system. These codes are the Employee Location Codes that are associated to a Location in the Employee Location Codes (Mapping) Module Item. If the LOCATION_CODE provided on the file is not associated to a Location in the system, the Hours will be stored at the TEMP Location. (This is a required field).<p><img src="assets/images/Employee Hours Email for robohelp_files/image3.png" alt="Picture 1"/></p></li><li>YYYY: This column contains the Year of the Employee Hours. It must be a 4-digit number. (This is a required field).</li><li>MM: This column contains the Month of the Employee Hours. It must be a 2-digit number. Example: February=02, December=12. (This is a required field).<ul data-start="6.1"><li>Note: Leading zeros will need to be sent for 1-digit months. If a CSV File is opened in Excel, the leading zeros may be dropped. </li><li>Note: The system will not accept Hours for future dates, therefore forecasting of hours will cause an exception in the file. </li></ul></li><li>HOURLY_HRS: This column is for the total number of Hours for Hourly Employees. </li><li>TEMP_HRS: This column is for the total number of Hours for Temporary Employees.</li><li>SALARY_HRS: This column is for the total number of Hours for Salary Employees. </li><li>NUMBER_EMP: This column is the total Number of Employees at the specified Location. </li></ul><p> </p><p>II: Ongoing File Feeds</p><p> </p><ul data-start="1" class="List1" xmlns=""><li>Summed Hours: Employee Hours are processed as 1 summed value for each Location per Month. Therefore if you are sending multiple files in 1 month, keep in mind that the latest total of Hours will override any existing values for that month. <ul data-start="1.1"><li>Example: If a file is sent week 1 with 200 Hours, and an additional 200 Hours are worked the following week, the file will need to contain 400 Total Hours as this functions as a running month-to-date sum. </li></ul></li><li>Adjustments: Negative Numbers are not accepted by the Electronic Data Interface (EDI). If an adjustment of hours is needed, enter the new total of hours which will override the existing value in the system.</li><li>Frequency: Our EDI can process Employee Hours Files at any frequency of your choice. (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.) </li><li>Manual Input of Hours: At any point in time, Employee Hours can be manually added or adjusted for any Location. (Injury and Illness Module &gt; Employee Hours Module Item)</li><li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP / SFTP): An FTP or SFTP Site will be used to securely transfer the files. The site and Log-In credentials for the FTP Site will be shared with both parties to integrate AIC with your HR System. Once a file is placed on the FTP Site, the Electronic Data Interface will process the file into your database. At this time you will receive an Acknowledgement File outlining the results of the processed file, and any exceptions that may have occurred. </li></ul><p> </p><p>III: Data Integrity</p><p> </p><p>To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements listed above.</p></div></body></html>
