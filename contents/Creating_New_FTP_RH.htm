In order to get access to the SFTP Site you will need to use a FTP application (such as FileZilla a free FTP solution that can be downloaded from the internet). You may need to involve your IT team as there may be an internal application that could be used for this process; and if not then you may need permission to download an application from the internet.</p><p> </p><p>Important Note: AIC cannot recommend or suggest any application (such as FileZilla) since they are third party solutions that AIC does not have control over; however the screenshot of the FileZilla application shown below is what AIC uses for both FTP and SFTP file transfers with our clients today. </p><p> </p><p>Once within the application you will be asked to provide the following four data fields (which I have highlighted in the screenshot below):</p><ol data-start="1" class="List0" xmlns=""><li>Host: sftp.appsint.com</li><li>Username: </li><li>Password: Please call the office 858.673.2174 to receive the password over the phone for security purposes.</li><li>Port: 22</li></ol><p><img src="assets/images/Creating New FTP RH_files/image1.png" alt="Picture 1"/></p><p>After access has been granted you will be able to navigate through the directories (aka folders) as well as upload and retrieve files when necessary.</p><p> </p></div></body></html>
