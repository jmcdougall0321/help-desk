      ‎<a id="_Toc3209773"></a><span>The AIC Approach</span></h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Our approach is to make your implementation as uneventful as possible.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>To do this, we rely on our track record of large scale successful implementations, detailed project documentation and good communication with the client and implementation team.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As part of the implementation we will provide:</p>
    <ul class="List19" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Project Documentation for integration points; Employee File, Employee Hours File, etc.</li>
      <li>Excel based templates for defining pick list values, with defaults.</li>
      <li>Excel based templates for the upload of historical data.</li>
      <li>Environment for reviewing loaded data.
        <ul data-start="4.1">
          <li>As your Organization Structure and Location Data are loaded…review it!</li>
          <li>As your pick list values are pre-populated…review it!!</li>
          <li>As your historical data is loaded…review it!!</li>
          <li>As part of the training process, we will create a copy of this environment for training your users.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Web based portal, <a href="https://projects.appsint.com/">https://projects.appsint.com</a> for tracking all implementation specific supporting documentation, tracking action items with estimated completion dates (all enforced by automated email alerts and messaging), and status updates on the implementation. All implementation team members, both AIC and client, have access to the site and are encouraged to contribute.</li>
      <li>Weekly “Touch Base” Meetings for discussing action item status, addressing questions from the group and to identify any impediments to the implementation.
        <ul data-start="6.1">
          <li>“Touch Base” Meetings are held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. The group will agree upon a time and a meeting notice will be provided.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Many of the action items happen in parallel. AIC has developed several tools that allow for the quick upload of project management data. For this reason it is important that data be provided in the exact format requested for quicker turnaround times.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Next Stop…the GET ROLLING Meeting!!!</p>
    <h1><br/>
      ‎<a id="_Toc3209774"></a><span>Implementation Tools - AIC Project Site</span></h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As part of the implementation process, we also provide a web based tool for tracking all projects - supporting documentation as well as action items. Both the (Client Name) Implementation Team and the AIC Support Team will use the projects site to share necessary documents. All (Client Name) Implementation Team members will have access to the projects site.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><a href="https://projects.appsint.com/">https://projects.appsint.com/</a></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>You will be provided with login credentials (user name and password) for the Projects Site.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>After logging in, you will be able to see the list of outstanding projects, action items and completion status. You will also be able to access the documentation needed for the project from the Files mini tab.</p>

    <p>For optimal compatibility with your Application and the Projects Site, you will need to ensure your Internet Browser Settings are configured correctly. Located on the Projects Site within the Corporate Document Library, you will find documents outlining the settings that need to be updated on your browser to experience the applications full functionality.</p>

    <p> </p>
    <p><br/>
      ‎<span> </span></p>
    <h1><a id="_Toc3209778"></a>Touch Base Meetings</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As part of the Implementation Process, we will schedule reoccurring Touch Base Meetings on a weekly basis. These meetings typically last anywhere from 15-30 minutes, and are used to go over the status of the Implementation and answer any questions you have. Touch Base Meetings can be scheduled weekly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Prior to the first Touch Base Meeting, we must have your Database created. The following items are needed in order for AIC to create your database:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul class="List1" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Customized Site URL</li>
      <li>Application Name</li>
      <li>Company Logo</li>
      <li>Languages chosen</li>
      <li>Alert Details</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>AIC also requires that you provide your Organization Structure and Locations prior to the first Touch Base Meeting. Everything in the system is tied back to the Location, therefore it is important to have this in place when beginning the Implementation. You can upload this to the Files mini tab on the Project Site.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>We will work with your team to find a date and time each week that will work with your schedule. Everyone who is actively involved in the Implementation will be invited to join via WebEx Webinar.</p>
    <p> </p>

      ‎<span> </span></p>
    <h1><a id="_Toc3209779"></a>Organization Structure/Location Data</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The Organization Structure and Location List are key elements within the application, as all of the data ties back to the location. After the initial upload, we will cover how to maintain the Organization Structure through tools provided in the application in the Administrator Training.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The documents for this can be found on our projects website at <a href="https://projects.appsint.com/">https://projects.appsint.com</a>, Corporate Document Library.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The template contains two worksheets:</p>
    <ul class="List42" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Locations to Load – Please use the corresponding worksheet to provide a list of your work locations to be uploaded in the application.</li>
      <li>Org Structure Example – The system will not only store your locations but allows you to map out your Organization Structure as well. This worksheet is an example of an Org Structure to aid in the documentation process.</li>

    <h1><a id="_Toc3209781"></a>Employee File (Demographic) Feed</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System is an open platform and provides the ability to “load” employee demographic information from an HRIS or Employee Demographic System on an ongoing basis. With this in place, data entry is streamlined as there is no need to manually enter employees into the application.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The document that explains the secure process for bringing over employee data on a periodic basis can be found at <a href="https://projects.appsint.com/">https://projects.appsint.com</a>, Corporate Document Library. This document includes details on:</p>
    <ul class="List10" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>File Format (Fixed Width or CSV)</li>
      <li>File Naming</li>
      <li>Record Inclusion</li>

        <p>Data Integrity</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>People Role Assignments</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Role assignments are available for employees as part of the upload process. These can be assigned individually or by groups/profile levels. Each user can have as many or as few roles as needed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Assignments can be made at the time of adding employees or after exploration of the application.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>By selecting a specific role that employee will automatically populate into any drop downs or pick lists that requires a responsible person for that location.</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System is an open platform and provides the ability to “load” employee hours worked demographic information from an HRIS or Payroll System on an ongoing basis. With this in place, data entry is streamlined as there is no need to manually enter this data into the application. This is information is used for Federal Compliance Reports, Frequency/Severity Rate Calculations and data normalization.</p>

    <h1><a id="_Toc3209785"></a>Incident Management Solution - Pick List Validation Tables</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Within the application we standardize and streamline data entry through pick lists (pre-defined values) instead of having the end user type in the values. This also ensures consistent data for accurate reporting. For many of the items you’ll find that there are default values for you to review, modify and send back for upload. The maintenance of these values going forward can be done within the application through the point and click user interface. There are several items that we strongly suggest be identified up front. The remaining items can be defined as users add records to the application.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>AIC provides default or example values for the majority of the picklists in the application.  A template for defining and uploading picklists can be found on the projects website at <a href="https://projects.appsint.com/">https://projects.appsint.com</a>, Corporate Document Library.</p>

    <h1><a id="_Toc3209786"></a>Case Numbering</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Within the application, each Incident that is entered is assigned a case number to use as an identifier. Below are the available options for Case Numbering.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>User Generated: This will be a free form text box for the User to manually enter any case number of your choice.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Auto Generated: A Case Number will be automatically assigned to each Incident by the system.</p>
    <ul class="List53" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>If choosing to use the system-generated case numbering, these can be generated as a sequence per Location, or on a global scale.
        <p class="ListParagraph"> </p>
        <ul data-start="1.1">
          <li>By Location – Each Location will have their own sequence. Example:
            <ul data-start="1.1.1">
              <li>San Diego Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003</li>
              <li>New York Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003</li>
              <li>Available Formats: (YYYY=Year, L=Location Code, M=Month, ###=Consecutive numbering)
                <ul data-start="1.1.3.1">
                  <li>YYYY-L-###</li>
                  <li>YYYY-L-####</li>
                  <li>MLYY###</li>
                  <li>YYYY-###
                    <p class="ListParagraph"> </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Global: The case numbers will be unique, regardless of which location the incident was created for. Example:</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="List48" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>San Diego Location: 2016-001, 2016-002, 2016-003</li>

    <p>One of the newest enhancements in the application is the ability to add custom fields on the General Details Tab within the Incident Input Forms. (Injury and Illness, Vehicle, General Liability, and Other). This is specific to the needs of your Organization, and can be customized per Incident Type. These can be added in the form of a Picklist, single line free-form text, multi-line text box, point and click date and time drop-downs, and check boxes.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>All of the custom fields added will be data that will flow to the Report Center and KPI Dashboards.</p>

    <p>Uploading your historical data into the application provides great back trend analysis capability and value to the Organization. Although not necessary for roll out, we have the ability to load your historical data to the application using a series of excel based templates. This provides the Organization an opportunity to review, consolidate and “scrub” their historical data if needed. Please identify the types, and sources, of your historical data and notify your AIC Implementation team. We will then provide you with the necessary templates and instructions for upload.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>AIC allows for a one-time upload of Historical Data per Module. We recommend gathering all data together prior to providing to AIC. Going forward, you can upload Historical Data manually into the application.</p>

    <p> </p>
    <p>The AIC Enterprise Compliance Management System provides the ability to submit Claims electronically to a Third Party Administrator. We have the ability to integrate with any TPA for Workers Compensation Claims, Vehicle Liability Claims, and General Liability Claims. This replaces:</p>
    <ul class="List9" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Phoning</li>
      <li>Faxing</li>
      <li>Emailing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>…and promotes data consistency by eliminating duplicate data entry.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER - AIC will NOT add client defined / custom fields to any existing Third Party Administrator (TPA) Claim Submission Electronic Data Integration (EDI). AIC has stringent security requirements as part of our System and Organization Controls (SOC) Report under the SSAE-18 standard audits, which limit AIC in sending anything outside the scope of the current integration. AIC will not do anything that may affect data integrity for our clients.</p>
    <p>**IMPORTANT NOTE - AIC is the first notification to the TPA, not the State. AIC will send the TPA the basic required information in order to file the First Report of Injury (FROI) with the insurance company/TPA. These are regulatory reports and AIC does not want to require anything beyond the basic requirements; based on our experience requiring additional fields may lead users to enter false information in order to get the claim submitted. Many times additional fields (beyond the basic requirements) are not available when the initial claim is entered and submitted to the TPA.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>To submit Workers Compensation claims from the application, we will need to work with your TPA to setup the process.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Please send an email to the TPA contact person we will need to work with, introducing AIC so they can be prepared and receptive for us to contact them.</p>

    <p>After the initial implementation of the system the time needed for ongoing maintenance of the application is minimal. Users who have administrator level access have the ability to maintain the following core data within the application.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Organization Structure</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As your Org Structure changes, you can use the drag and drop functionality within the application to easily make updates or add additional levels.</p>
    <ul class="List18" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>The Org Structure controls how the data rolls up for reporting purposes.</li>
      <li>If you move a location within the Org Structure, the data automatically moves with it since data is tied to locations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Locations</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Update the application to add any new locations, make them in-active, or closed.</p>
    <ul class="List33" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Usually a location will be a physical location.</li>
      <li>Incidents and employees are tied to locations.</li>

      <li>User access to application functionality is determined by the user “Profile” they are assigned to.</li>
      <li>User Profiles can be modified by administrators.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Tools</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Once you’ve gone live with the application there are a series of tools available for measuring system usage:</p>
    <ul class="List11" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Login History for tracking login attempts; successful and unsuccessful.</li>
      <li>Last Login Date per User</li>
      <li>Automated Email Alerts</li>
      <li>Using the Automated Reports for verifying the type and quality if the data being entered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As part of the implementation process your Implementation Lead will walk through these tools and make some recommendations on how you may want to use them based on your business processes.<a id="_Toc357770075"></a><a id="_Toc358114293"></a></p>

    <p>Although AIC is able to customize various areas of the system during the implementation process; for any change that will require AIC development work the AIC Discovery Process will be required. This is the full process we adhere to for all changes/enhancements. Depending on the size and scope of the change, this process may take anywhere from a few minutes for a simple label change to several months for a new module. The final product will be a document that will detail development work and associated time and cost. The investment in these services is typically $200.00 per hour (may change at AIC upper management discretion), billed as actual. If you want to proceed with development, we will credit the discovery process fee to your project.</p>
