    <p class="Header">Overview</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p>This document will explain the benefits and importance of setting up custom profile levels for the AIC system. Going forward these can be modified and new profiles added to meet the needs of the Organization.</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header">The 3 most Common Profile Types are:</p>
    <ul class="List28" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>ADMINISTRATOR</li>
      <li>RECORDKEEPER (aka End User)</li>
      <li>READ ONLY ( aka View Only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header">By separating out different levels, you are granting access or limiting access based on the selections in the Profile Setup Form. How the leveling system works is that the lower the level #, the higher access ability the user will have. For example, if there are 4 levels set up in the application, the level 4&#39;s will have the &quot;lowest&quot; level of access, and will not have the ability to change the security setup for any of the level 3&#39;s, 2&#39;s, and level 1&#39;s access. The level 3&#39;s will have access to update the security setup for any of the level 4&#39;s because they are at a &quot;lower&quot; level. The level 2&#39;s can update the security setup for any of the level 3&#39;s &amp; 4&#39;s etc.</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header">ADMINISTRATOR – Level 1</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p>This level is used for the head company Administrators who will be the ultimate decision makers for all actions within the application. For example, these users will be Adding/Editing Locations, Modifying the Organization Structure, Adding/Editing Pick Lists, User Setup, and Security Profiles Setup for Users, as well as Alerts setup. Users at this level (Usually only a select few) will have access to everything in the application, as well as access to all locations.</p>
    <p>Administrators have the ability to make updates to any profile with a level that is &quot;higher&quot;. EX: Level 2&#39;s, Level 3&#39;s or higher.</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header"><br/>
      ‎RECORDKEEPER <span>– Level 2</span></p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header">This level is used for the users who will be entering in data on a daily basis. For example, these users will be Adding/Editing Incident Records, Entering Employee Hours, Corrective Actions/Activity Calendar, and Basic Reporting including OSHA reports. Recordkeepers usually only have access to 1 Location (Work Location).</p>
    <p class="Header">Users in Level 2 have the ability to make updates to any profile with a level that is &quot;higher&quot;. EX: Level 3&#39;s or higher</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header">READ ONLY – Level 3</p>
    <p class="Header"> </p>
    <p class="Header">This level is used for the users who will only be able to View, Print, and/or Pull Reports from the application. These users will be unable to Add, Edit, or Delete any data within the system.</p>
    <p>Users in Level 3 (If there are no other levels &quot;higher&quot;) will not have the ability to make any updates to any profile, even their own.</p>
