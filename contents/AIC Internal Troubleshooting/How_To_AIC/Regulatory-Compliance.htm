    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 1</span>: User will login to the application and navigate to the Regulatory Compliance Module.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step2: </span>There will be 4 Module items for the Regulatory Compliance Module in order to accomplish Compliance requirement goals.</p>
    <ol class="List1" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Regulatory Compliance Requirements</li>
      <li>Permit Details</li>
      <li>Requirement Details</li>
      <li>Location Profile</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 3:</span> The Regulatory Compliance Requirements Module Item will be used to create the main data elements for tracking and reporting. These will be the events, permits, licenses, etc. that can either be a standalone project for tracking or can be combined to make up a larger requirement.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 4: </span>The Permit Details Module Item will be used for maintaining the location based permits and any additional requirements associated with any permits. This involves the examination of various client defined qualifications and renewal procedures as well as verification that specified requirements have been met.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 5:</span> The Requirement Details Module Item will be used for maintaining the location based requirements. This involves the examination of various client defined qualifications and renewal procedures as well as verification that specified requirements have been met within the specified recurrence patterns.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 6:</span> The Location Profile Module Item will be used as the Dashboard for viewing the comprehensive list of All Regulatory Compliance Requirement Details as well as any supporting documentation tied back to individual Locations.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 7: </span>The Regulatory Agency Module Item from the Administration Module will be used for adding and maintaining client defined Reporting Agencies that are requiring these action items in order to ensure and assess compliance. These values will flow to Regulatory Compliance.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 8:</span> The Responsible Person Mini Tab within the Location Input Screen is used as an administrative function for assigning Regulatory Compliance responsible people for each location. Each location can have unique responsible people as well as one default responsible person.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Step 9:</span> All of the outlined changes will have its data flow to the Report Builder, Activity Calendar, as well as the automated outbound alerts.</p>

      <li>Make no changes to the record (unless changes are needed)</li>
