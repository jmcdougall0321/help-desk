    <p>During today’s touch base meeting you were asking about how Employee Hours could be represented in dashboard indicators. You wanted to display work hours by Month as a column. Currently you can only display by Hour Type with this indicator type. A workaround would be to use the Counter indicator type and create/copy one for each date range. I created the first indicator for the date range January then copied it down updating the date ranges for each month thereafter.</p>

    <p>In Report Center, there are several reports that will show you the number of hours worked by location.</p>
    <ul class="List0" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Employee Hours by Location
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>

      </li>
      <li>Expanse Energy Hours / # of EEs</li>
    </ul>
