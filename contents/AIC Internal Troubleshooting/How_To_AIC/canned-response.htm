  <h2><span style="font-size:28px;">Canned Response for Future Enhancements </span> </h2>
  <div>
    <p>Hi Teams,</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>We are going to make some small changes to make everyone’s life much easier. Our current future enhancement policy is flaky, unprofessional, and it’s a burden on you all to have you constantly bombarded with unhappy clients who are confused. If it is decided that an enhancement request is something is not happening now, we need to be more transparent. This was we set reasonable expectations with people.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Of course, sometimes clients request things and we do them immediately and go around this process. Exceptions to rules cannot be avoided with technology – it is always changing. Please copy me on all of these emails, I want to be able to jump in if you get push back from a client so that you can retain a nice rapport with the people you are working with. Lauren will be polishing this up for a formal policy. Please move forward with this immediately, just copy and paste.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>When a client submits an enhancement request, after you have created a ticket (or a ticket has been automatically created via aicsupport):</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>“Hi Client, thank you for your enhancement request. Enhancement requests are reviewed on a bi-weekly basis, every other Thursday, so I will get back to you no later than the following Friday on the status of this item.”</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>After the request is reviewed, one of two options:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>We ARE doing it:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>“Hi Client, Thank you for your enhancement request. This item was accepted for development, and will be discussed at our development next week, for scheduling. This item may need additional documentation and discovery, so we may be reaching out to schedule a meeting next week to find out more. If there is a discovery process that requires documentation, a sign off from you will be required. Once the discovery is completed, this task is assigned to a developer. We will communicate updates on this process as they happen. Once the item is completed, it goes through rigorous QA testing to make sure that the system and functionally are working as designed. This is a part of our SOC 1 policy for proficiency and success and we thank you for being partners in this process.”</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>We are not doing it:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>“Thank you for your feedback regarding this enhancement request. Your requests have been documented. When we are updating this module, we will reach out for feedback, however this is not on our 2019 roadmap. We are happy to share how this process works. Please let Elle McDougall, copied here know if you would like to set up a call so we can explain a little more about our enhancement and discovery process. ”.</p>
