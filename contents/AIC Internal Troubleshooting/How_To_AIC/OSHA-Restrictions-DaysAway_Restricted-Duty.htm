      <p class="Title">Days Away\Restricted Duty - 180 Day Cap</p>
    </div>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The system caps the days away/ restricted duty days/ job transfer days at 180 days combined on the 300 log, in accordance with the OSHA Recordkeeping Rules.   Per 29 CFR 1904.7(b)(3)(vii), you may &quot;cap&quot; the total days away at 180 calendar days. You are not required to keep track of the number of calendar days away from work if the injury or illness resulted in more than 180 calendar days away from work and/or days of job transfer or restriction.</p>
    <p>You can track days away/restricted/job transfer beyond 180 days in the incident record, however the 300 log will cap at 180 days combined. In addition, according to OSHA restrictions the system applies the counting logic, giving priority to Days Away as they are considered more severe.</p>
