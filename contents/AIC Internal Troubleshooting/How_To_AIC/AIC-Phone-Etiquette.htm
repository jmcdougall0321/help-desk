    <ol class="List8" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Service in Support: Problem or a Fix
        <ol data-start="1.1">
          <li>If something needs to be fixed you need to get the necessary information from the client so we know exactly what needs to be fixed

          <li>Have them walk you through the steps that they are taking so you know exactly what they are doing and if it’s an issue
            <ol data-start="2.3.1">
              <li>Training: If somebody needs to be taught something then you need to find out what it is that they don&#39;t understand and you need to work with them to schedule a time so that you can train them in the application
                <ol data-start="2.3.1.1">
                  <li>All about listening to what they want</li>
                  <li>The system isn’t broken – the client isn’t using the application correctly</li>
