You can still report of the historical data as it would remain intact. I would also take caution in deactivate picklist values that are required for your claim submission as this would cause issue for your end users when trying to submit claims.\n        ","Could we submit AIC a list of options that we are considering making inactive?","\n      ","\n      ","If this list is rather long and extensive, you can absolutely submit a file in excel format containing the picklist items you would like removed.
