(Recommended). We also accept any other type of delimiter. Ex: pipe delimited)","\n      ","Fixed Width","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n    ","I have attached the Employee Demographic File CSV Template for you to provide all of the Employee information. (This is the recommended format for file transfer) I have also attached documentation outlining the field descriptions and Required Fields for the Employee Demographic File.","\n    "," ","\n    ","I: Fields","\n    "," ","\n    ","See below for a list of required fields within the template:","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","EMPLOYEE_LOCATION_CODE: Employee Location Code is Column A in the attached template. This is the Employee’s specific Work Location. This column must contain Location Codes that already exist in the system. These codes are the Employee Location Codes that are associated to a Location in the Employee Location Codes (Mapping) Module Item. If the LOCATION provided on the file is not associated to a Location in the system, the Employee will be stored at the TEMP Location.\n            "," ","\n          ","\n          ","EMPLOYEE_NUMBER: Column B in the attached template. This is used as the Unique Identifier for each Employee, and cannot contain any duplicate values.\n            "," ","\n          ","\n          ","CATEGORY: Category of Employment: Column G in the attached template. The default options for this column are:\n            ","\n              ","Full-Time","\n              ","Part-Time","\n              ","Seasonal","\n              ","Temporary","\n              ","Retired","\n              ","Contractor (OSHA Exempt)","\n              ","Non-Employee (OSHA exempt)","\n              ","Note: You can either choose to use our default values, or AIC can associate your organization’s current categories of employment within the system.\n                "," ","\n              ","\n            ","\n          ","\n          "," EMPLOYEE_STATUS: Column H in the attached template. The default values are:\n            ","\n              ","Active","\n              ","Inactive","\n              ","You can use our default values, or AIC can associate your organization’s current statuses within the system.\n                "," ","\n              ","\n            ","\n          ","\n          ","HIRE_DATE: Column K in the attached template. (Please use the following format: MM/DD/YYYY)\n            "," ","\n          ","\n          ","TERMINATION_DATE: (If reporting Inactive Employees, this field is required. If not, this field can be left blank) Column L in the attached template.

Note: This field is only required if your organization is providing the Supervisor First Name and Last Name. If not, this field can be left blank.","\n        ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n    ","II: Ongoing File Feeds","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n      ","Frequency: Our EDI can process Employee Demographic Files at any frequency of your choice. (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)","\n      ","Manual Input of Employees: At any point in time, Employees can be manually added into the system by using the People Module Item in either Administration or Injury and Illness Module. Keep in mind that the Employee Number is the unique identifier for each Employee. If the Employee Number is manually inputted, and the Employee is added within the next Employee File, the system will link the Employee Record and override any data that was previously saved for that Employee. If the Employee Number is left blank, the system will create a duplicate record with the new Employee File Data.","\n      ","Full File vs. Delta File: For automated ongoing file feeds, you can choose to send a full Employee File each time, this will update any changes made to Employee records (Ex: Changing from Active to Inactive). Or you can choose to only send a Delta File which only contains the updates and new Employees from the file.","\n      ","File Transfer Protocol (FTP / SFTP): An FTP or SFTP Site will be used to securely transfer the files. The site and Log-In credentials for the FTP Site will be shared with both parties to integrate AIC with your HR System. Once a file is placed on the SFTP Site, the Electronic Data Interface will process the file into your database. At this time you will receive an Acknowledgement File outlining the results of the processed file, and any exceptions that may have occurred.","\n      ","Important Note: Since Employee Data contains sensitive information, please do not email / attach the completed Employee Demographic file, as this is not a secure way of transmitting the data. Using an FTP/SFTP Site will securely transfer the files. If an FTP Site has not been set up, you can choose to utilize the Files mini tab within the Project Site.","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n    ","III: Data Integrity","\n    "," ","\n    ","To protect the integrity and accuracy of your data, it is AIC Policy that we do not manipulate your files in any way. This includes: modifying headers, adjusting data fields, associating locations, adding leading zeros, etc. If a file is provided with incorrect or incomplete data, we will return the file and request for a revised file that meets all requirements listed above.","\n    "," ","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n\n"],"id":"30"})
