    <p class="normal0">Is there a way I can log in so I can I have the view which a Plant Manager or Distribution Manager would have.  I would like to see how it looks from their end so I can set it up right when I am logged in under admin mode.</p>
    <p class="normal0"> </p>
    <p class="normal0">Also, the training site was going to get set up and I still don’t have access.  Can this be done?</p>
    <p class="normal0"> </p>
    <p class="normal0"> </p>
    <p class="normal0">I have created a user called “AG User” which you can use to log in with different Security Profiles.  To view the user record, go to the Administration Module, Users Module item.  Select “AG User” from the search grid and then “Edit”.  The AG User currently has the Plant Manager Security profile and has access to all locations.  To change the Security Profile, select the dropdown arrow in the Profile box and you will see the entire list of available Security Profiles.  The username and password are the same - “AGUser”. </p>
    <p class="normal0"> </p>
    <p class="normal0"> The training data base has been created.  You should be able to log in now with the same username/password as the production database.</p>
