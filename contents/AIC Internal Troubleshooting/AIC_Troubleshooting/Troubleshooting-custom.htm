    <p>Clients like to customize their systems, they often reach out asking to hide/show/etc. certain fields in the application. Let’s take a look at how you can determine if/where you can do this (hint- for the most part, the answer is yes!)…</p>
    <p><img alt="þÿ" src="../../assets/images/Troubleshooting for robohelp custom_files/image1.jpeg" /></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Step 1 – What is the client asking for?</p>
    <ul class="List1" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>To turn on something that they don’t see
        <ul data-start="1.1">
          <li>Example “do you have a section for tracking drug testing that we can use?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To hide a field
        <ul data-start="2.1">
          <li>Example “can we hide the severity consequence matrix?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To make a field required
        <ul data-start="3.1">
          <li>Example “we want to require incident level” Let’s take a look!
            <p> </p>
            <p>Step 2 – Where can we do these things?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There are 3 main areas we can check for these type of requests:
        <ul data-start="4.1">
          <li>Form actions in the profile security
            <ul data-start="4.1.1">
              <li>This will accommodate a variety of things, most things are available here so I recommend you check here first (things like requiring fields, hiding fields, turning on sections of the form, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Customize module
            <ul data-start="4.2.1">
              <li>Customize not only enables you to add new fields on forms but it also can hide/read-only/require fields. This depends on if the form is available to customize. Currently the forms that have this availability are as follows below. Please note, any form that does NOT have customize does not have any of this functionality, this is ONLY for these forms:</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul class="List0" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>
        <ul data-start="1.1">
          <li>
            <ul data-start="1.1.1">
              <li>
                <ul data-start="1.1.1.1">
                  <li>General Details within all incident modules</li>
                  <li>Corrective action input form across all modules</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Variables
            <ul data-start="1.2.1">
              <li>While this is the ‘oldest’ option, there are still a lot of valuable system customization options in here. The variables are located under aic tools &gt; variables. This grid is somewhat complex to search so I recommend searching only a small part of what you are looking for in the variable name column. Sometimes you have to do a few searches to see if anything is available using different keywords.
                <ul data-start="1.2.1.1">
                  <li>For example, if you were looking for ‘drug and alcohol test’, try to search ‘drug’ then try ‘test’. Eventually you will determine if it is available or not by searching here.</li>
                  <li>This is typically the last resort, use the profile first</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Turn on/Turn off module item
            <ul data-start="1.3.1">
              <li>If you cant locate something in the profile, it may simply not be turned on in the system. AIC controls what is on and what is off through the aic tools module &gt; turn on turn off module item (known as TOTO).</li>
              <li>Within TOTO, you can update each module, and search for form actions that are not turned on.
                <ul data-start="1.3.2.1">
                  <li>Checked = turned on, available in the profile</li>
                  <li>Unchecked = turned off, not available in the profile</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>You might be wondering, why don’t we just turn everything in TOTO on?
                <ul data-start="1.3.3.1">
                  <li>It is based on what the client licenses.</li>
                  <li>Many of the available things DO NOT WORK. Take caution with the grid buttons and reports as some of these are turned off for a reason. If in doubt, just check with someone!
                    <p>Step 3 – It’s not available currently:</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Let the client know it is not available.</li>
      <li>If they push back asking us to add it after you let them know it isn’t available, add it to the potential future enhancements list (check first to see if anyone else has added it to avoid duplicates).</li>
    </ul>
