  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">Good Afternoon,</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">We are having a handful of users that are receiving an error message when they attempt to edit a corrective action from either the activity calendar or from within an event module.</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">Attached are screenshots from one users that sees this message.</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">&quot;Sequence contains more than one element&quot;</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">I have asked these users to clear the cache and Flush </span><span lang="en">DNS</span><span lang="en">, but they are still receiving this error message.</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">I am able to open the corrective action and update the necessary information on my computer.</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">This happened in November. I believe it had something to do with the security in the profile.</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">This user has the following profile: Vegetation Manager </span><span lang="en">Recordkeeper</span><span lang="en">.</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en">Let me know if you need any additional information</span></p>
  <p class="normalweb"> </p>
  <p class="normalweb"> </p>
  <p class="normalweb"><span lang="en"></span></p>
  <p class="normal0">I was able to track down the issue causing the error message.  It was due to duplicate forms in the profile security for the profile you provided.  I have removed the duplicate and will put it a task to have and additional duplicates removed from existing profiles.  But if you receive any reports of this moving forward I would look in the profile security for duplicate entries.</p>
