    <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Client:</span> I have some people getting an &quot;Internal Server Error - 500&quot; I believe we have had this issue before but I can&#39;t seem to find the emails.is this a Cache problem?</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Support:</span> Where exactly are your users experiencing this error? Can you please provide a screenshot, the module or module item and some examples of users that this is occurring for?</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Client:</span> For some reason it is on the same incident, this is two different users experiencing the same issue. Anytime they try to edit case number 2018-SEC-3630 and save and close it gives them the attached screenshot. I was able to go in and save something with no issues. I was thinking it could be a compatibility view settings issue or maybe some type of browser cookies issue but wanted to confirm before proceeding.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:20px;">Support:</span> Incident main tab. In reviewing the security settings for the SEC - FIELD SAFETY profile, it appears as though the form actions outlined in the screenshot below are causing the internal server error. If you uncheck these boxes, they should be able to navigate through the Vehicle Incident main tab without issue. These form actions aren’t actually relevant to the vehicle module so unchecking them will have no effect on their abilities to capture data for vehicle incidents.</p>

    <p>You’ll want to make sure that these form actions are unchecked for all of your SEC specific profiles. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
