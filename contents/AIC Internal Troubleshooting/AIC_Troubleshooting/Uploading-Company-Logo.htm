      <li>Is there a manual that is searchable when I have simple questions like the above?
        <ul data-start="3.1">
          <li>There is a Tutorials module item within the tools module that has a number of useful tutorials on various items throughout the database. We don’t necessarily have a manual that encompasses everything. When you navigate to the Tools module item, you can search within the headers to locate the type of instruction or guidance that you are looking for.</li>
