    <p> </p>
    <p>The number of restricted days is not adding/transferring correctly to the OSHA 300 and 300A</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Thank you for your email. We are looking into this and will follow up with additional details as they become available.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Thank you for your patience. After reviewing the incident data and the OSHA 300 log for the Tacoma location, the number of days (Away from work + On job transfer or restriction) is maxing at 180 days for each incident.</p>
    <p>Please let us know if you have any further questions!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Just curious, Is this per OSHA that logs max out at 180 days? In case it comes up again, might be best for the team to understand.</p>

    <p>Counting days:</p>
    <ul class="List0" data-start="1" xmlns="">
      <li>Begin counting days away/restricted the day after the injury/illness occurred.</li>
      <li>Include weekends, holidays, etc. (whether EE scheduled to work or not)</li>
    </ul>
