    <p>Having trouble again with the 2nd Qtr. Assessment,  the score box not highlighted so will not let me input an answer. Ive tried both Google Chrome and Firefox. Please assist.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Is this only happening to Joe’s user account or have other uses with his Profile access also reported the same issue?</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>This is the first I’ve heard of it.  Everything is working fine for me</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>After further review, it appears as though Joe’s account is the only user associated to this profile that seems to be having this issue. I have created Task [28562] to have our development team look further into this. I will follow up with additional details as they become available</p>
