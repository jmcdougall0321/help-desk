    <p>I can&#39;t seem to edit the &quot;Require e-Learner to view content in predefined sequence&quot; or anything else that is greyed out on these classes in the Courses view.  Is it an ownership issue?  Can you please help me to get this solved?<br />

        ‎</span><span>This was a pre packed SCORM course uploaded by the EMCOR team the Require e-Learner to view content in predefined sequence does not apply because the rules/parameters of the course are built into the provided SCORM package.</span></p>
    <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
